        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Continuity would not be disrupted by such an action (according to the most viable opinion) even if his body had dried, because he was delayed due to an action required for his purity. The same is true if he were to move from one faucet to another in search of water. However, if continuity were disrupted due to an action not related to this, like removing impurity from his clothes, eating or drinking and the like, and the limbs became dry, then he needs to repeat the wudhu.

The same can be said of a person who is delayed from one water faucet-to-another in order to find water. A person cannot go on and on without interruption because he has not yet taken an action that will ensure his purity.

        "question": "If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and several prayers have passed, what should he do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl) and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, a translated meaning of which is: \"O' You who believe, do not get approach salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform ghusl\" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said \"I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned this to the Prophet peace be upon him (or it was mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, then perform ghusl\"2. This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situtations...? 1 Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer 1/199. 2 Narrated by Abu Dawood number 206 and verified sahih by Albani in Arwaa' al-Ghaleel number 125.",

        "question": "A lawyer in Argentina is asking about the ruling on circumcision for a disbelieving man or woman who wants to enter Islam.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question. The issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. Male circumcision in Islam As for circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam. It is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThen We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth.\u201d [an-Nahl 16:123] The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cThe prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old...\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6/388) Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam? Circumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it. Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam? It is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a person\u2019s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A person\u2019s entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised. With regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427. I ask Allah to enable you to do all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "This is a very difficult question to answer, and it is one that many people think is easy to answer. It is easier than most people think. For instance, the issue of male circumcision, which is mandatory in Islam, is quite difficult to answer because there are so many different answers to this question. Firstly, we have to ask whether male circumcision is mandatory for converting to Islam. If he can do it, then he will be able to convert even if he doesn't get circumcised. Secondly, does male circumcision mandatory for conversion? Circumstances are obligatory for Muslim men, if they are able to do them. Circumcision isn\u2019t mandatory for converts to Islam either. In fact, according to the Prophet, who was eighty-five years old when he first came to the faith, male circumcision must be required for conversion. Thirdly, though, is male circumcision \"necessary for conversion\". The Prophet has said that if a person's faith is sound, then his faith is valid only if he gets circumcised.",

        "question": "If a woman has a miscarriage and has discharge of blood, does she pray?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding (istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)? The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: \"If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas.\" (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361) In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays. Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy. (Majmu\u2019 Fatawa Ibn \u2018Uthaymin 4/292) This is based on the report of \u2018Abdullah Bin Mas\u2019ud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: \"Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed \" (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303) Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her. As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: \"What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas.\" (Majmu\u2019 Fatawa Ibn \u2018Uthaymin 4/327) Reference: \u201cWhat Should You Do in the Following Situations by Sheikh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid.",
        "summary": "Prologue: Post-natal bleeding, vaginal bleeding, nifas or extramarital bleeding. If she sees any blood after the birth of a human being, she is deemed \"nifas\" because it does not interfere with her regular period of prayer and prays. In contrast, if she sees anything after the delivery of a non-fertilized object, she's considered \"mustahada,\" so she prays for every prayer and then goes to sleep. In terms of time elapsed between pregnancy and delivery, according to the scholars, eighty one days before pregnancy. Pregnant women should spend more time trying to find out what time it is that they are going to get pregnant.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The answer that is apparent is: he acts based on what is clear to him from the signs of travel on the imam from clothes or travel gear. If it appears to him that the imam is resident, then he should pray the complete prayer. The evidence: what Imam Ahmad authenticated and narrated that Ibn Abbas was asked: \"What is reason that the traveler prays two rakaat (iterations of prayer) if he is alone and four rakaat if he is led in [a full] prayer by a resident?

The same if he began the prayer completely capable of performing all actions, then suddenly became unable to perform certain actions. In this case he continues praying in the best shape he can and builds on what he previously had completed as though nothing has changed in his condition.\"1 The evidence is: hadith Umran Bin Hossayn, (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, \"I had bawaseer (hemorrhoids) so I asked the Prophet (peace be upon him), about salaat, and he said: 'Pray standing up; if you cannot, then sitting down; if you can not, then on your side.' \"2 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations...? 1 Al-Mughni maa al-Sharh al-Kabeer 1/782, and likewise in Al-Majmooa lil-Nawawi 4/318. 2 Sunan Abu Dawood 922 and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 815",

The same applies to anyone who suffers from haemorrhoids. As soon as a person can do what he or she was unable to do when starting the prayer, then suddenly becomes incapacitated, then regains the ability to perform certain tasks, then resumes the prayer.

        "question": "What should one do if one is distracted during the prayer by something happening in ones environment, such as someone knocking on the door, or a child in danger, e.g. playing with an electrical outlet, etc., perhaps requiring him to move?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a person praying needs to do something relatively minor during prayer, like opening a door and the like, it is OK as long as his direction does not change from the qibla (direction of prayer). The evidence for this is what Abu Dawood narrated that Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her), said, \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), used to pray with the door closed, so I arrived and asked him to open it, so he came and opened it and returned to his prayer\" (the narrator mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qibla).1 The same is true if a mother needed, while praying, to save her child from danger or harm and the likesmall movement to the right or left, or forward or backward, does not harm the prayer. Similarly if the ridaa (upper body cover) falls off, the praying person can pick it up and if the izar (lower body cover) became loose, then he can tighten it up. The sharia (laws of Islam) have allowed for the praying person in some cases excessive movement even if he were to change direction from qibla, as evident in the hadith of Abu Huraira, (may Allah be pleased with him), where he said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), said: Kill the two black things while in prayer: the snake and scorpion. \"2 Also, preventing a person from passing in the place of prostration by pushing (or even fighting him if he insists) is prescribed, as related in Bukhari from hadith Abi Saleh Al-Samman, who said: \"I saw Aba Saeed Al-Khudri on Friday praying with something in front of him to protect him from [passing] people, and a young man from Bani Abi Muaet wanted to pass in front of him in the place of prostration. So Abu Saeed pushed the mans chest, so the man looked [around] and did not find any place from which to walk except in front of him, so he tried to pass in front of him again. Abu Saeed pushed him harsher than the first time, so he cursed Abu Saeed. Then the young man went to Marwan and complained about Abu Saeeds action and Abu Saeed entered after him at Marwans place so Marwan said: What is the matter with you, doing that to your brothers son oh Abu Saeed.? He said: I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: \"If one of you prays with something in front of him protecting him from [passing] people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should push him, and if he refuses to [turn back], then fight him, for he is a shaitan (satan).\"3 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations...? 1 Sunan Abu Dawood, number 922, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 815.2 Sunan Abu Dawood, number 921, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 814.3 Narrated al-Bukhari Fath 1/582.",
        "summary": "Praise for to Allah. If a person is asked to do something minor during prayer and does not change his direction from the Qibla (qibla) to the \"direction of prayer,\" then it's OK. The narrator also points out that if the praying person is doing something relatively minor, such as opening a door or closing a door, it's okay as long as he doesn't move in the wrong direction. Similarly, when a mother needs assistance while praying, she should be able to use her child's life-saving movement to avoid danger or harm. Praying is OK even if he moves in the opposite direction. It just depends on how the person is moving. If the ridaae (upper body covering) is loose, then there's no need to tighten it up; if the ulamaa (lower upper body cover) becomes loose, then he can tight it up. As far as we're concerned, this isn't an excessive movement - it's just excessive movement. When people are praying, they shouldn't be using their qibla as a stepping stone to changing direction. In other words, if someone is asking you to pray, please open a door and/or close a door. Also, don't move too far forward or backward if you're going to harm your child. Lastly, if a person asks you to kill the two blackthings while in prayer, then pick it up. Pray be to Allah!",

As for Allah's right it cannot be requited but with true repentance. The right of the immediate kin can be requited by the murderer by handing himself over to them in order that they either: a) turn him over to the authorities for execution; b) accept monetary compensation from him; or c) forgive him. The right of the person himself who was murdered cannot be compensated for in this world. Some scholars are of the opinion - and this seems to be the preferable opinion - that if the murderer is true in his repentance, Allah will clear him of his sin and compensate on his behalf by satisfying the person murdered on the Day of Judgment.",

He also praises the \"three rights\" of the murderer - namely, that of Allah, his or her \"mediate kin,\" and those who are responsible for the murder.

Finally, the third rights are the \"Three Rights\" of Allah -- that of the victim, his/her immediate family, and those whose property was lost on the day of Judgment.

When a singer repents he should not return the wages he earned to the band to which he belonged or the party which paid. When a man who used to sell wine or drugs repents he should not return the amounts to those who used to buy from him. Nor should he who used to swear for others as a false witness return the amounts he earned to those for whose benefit he used to swear. The reason being that if he returns the amounts to him who paid, then he will be depositing with him both the unlawful money as well as the unlawful commodity that he took through bribe or wages of sin. Therefore it will be enough if he gets rid of such unlawful earning himself. This is the preference of Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah as well as his pupil Ibn ul-Qayyim as stated in his Madarij.",

And is it obligatory for him to bear the costs of the child\u2019s upbringing?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Questions of this sort are asked so often and by so many that it is time Muslims paid serious attention to their reformation in the light of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), in order that such things do not occur in the first place. Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full hijab (women\u2019s Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations. Either the man did it by force, that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to the law of shari\u2019ah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except repentance. Neither the child is his, nor is the cost of upbringing born by him because it is an illegal child and must be attached to the mother and not the father. The man\u2019s marriage to the woman, for the sake of covering up the issue, is also not permissible. For Allah revealed in the Quran a verse whose meaning can be translated as: \u201cAn adulterer does not marry but an adulteress or mushrika (female polytheist). And an adulteress does not marry but an adulterer or mushrik (male polytheist).\u201d (24:3) It is also not permissible to marry a woman who is pregnant from an adulterous act, even if the man has fathered the baby in the womb, as it is also not permissible to marry a woman about whom it is not known if she is pregnant or not. Nonetheless, if he repents, and she also repents, and she is not carrying a child, then it is permissible for him to marry her and begin a new life. If she is carrying a child, they must wait until she gives birth. And Allah knows best.",

        "question": "If a person has already prayed in a mosque then goes to another one and finds people there praying the congregational prayer, should he pray again?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a person prays in a mosque and then goes to another one to attend a lecture or for any other reason, and finds the people there praying, then he should join them and his prayer would be considered a supererogatory (nafilah, nafl, tatawwu\u2018) prayer. He should do so even if it is during the prohibited times of prayer because there is a reason behind it. The evidence for this comes from what has been narrated in the hadith of Yazid bin Al-Aswad (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sunan Al-Tirmidhi in the chapter on \u201cWhat has been reported about a person who prayed alone and then joins a congregation\u201d: \u201cHe said: I performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and prayed Fajr with him in Masjid Al-Khayf. When he completed his prayer and turned around, he found two people who did not pray with him. He said: I have to talk to them. So he came to them and they were trembling. He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that. If you already prayed at your places and then came to a congregational mosque, pray with them too and it will become a supererogatory prayer for you.\u201d (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, No. 219; Sahih Al-Jami\u2018, No. 667) In another hadith it is narrated that the two came after the Fajr prayer which is a prohibited time for prayer. Imam Malik has reported in Muwatta in the chapter on \u201cWhat has been narrated about repeating the prayer with the Imam after a person has prayed individually\u201d: Mihjan (may Allah be pleased with him), says that he was in the company of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in congregation and returned while Mihjan himself did not pray with them. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: What prevented you from praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim? He said: Indeed, O Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)! But I had already prayed at home. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: When you come (to the mosque) then pray with the people even if you have prayed.\u201d For more about repeating prayers, please see these answers: 90038, 9023, and 32680.

The evidence for this comes from what Imam Muslim has narrated in his Sahih: Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If iqamah is called for the prayer then there is no prayer except the obligatory one. (Sahih Muslim, 1/493) So, if one has performed the ruku\u2018 for the second rak\u2018ah, then he should complete the prayer, and if not, then he should discontinue because what is left from his sujud and tashahhud is not needed any more. Moreover, he should break without salaam, and it is enough to have the intention in the heart, contrary to common misconception.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the right direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is also true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been performed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration by Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that: While the Prophet (peace be upon him) was praying towards Bayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of meaning): Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram. (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found them (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of ruku\u2018 in the Fajr prayer in the second rak\u2018ah. He shouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. So, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet and his Companions) have. (Sahih Musim, No. 527) If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it was made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of qiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying together in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some towards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference of opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was complete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If there was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he should follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah.1 For the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if he can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability with the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is reliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and complete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of those who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform them of the correct direction of qiblah. If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and prayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was careless.2 1 Al-Mughni, 1/473. 2Al-Mughni, 1/490",

        "question": "What should one do if one is praying behind an imam and one misses one of the obligatory parts (arkaan)of the prayer?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If someone is praying in a congregation and the loud speaker stops working or the person is drowsy, and he lags behind the Imam by one or more obligatory acts (arkaan) of prayer (i.e., the Imam performed it and he could not because of not hearing the Imam\u2019s voice), then when he returns to consciousness or the sound of the speaker returns back, he should complete the missed obligatory acts and then continue with the Imam. This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam recited a verse that contains the word of prostration (sajdah) and the people misunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when the Imam says takbeer for ruku\u2018 at the end of the verse and performs ruku\u2018, some of the followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the takbeer for the prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from the ruku\u2018 saying \u201csami\u2018a Allahu li man hamidah\u201d, they return back (stand up) from their prostration. Thus, they missed the act of ruku\u2018 and standing up from it. So it is incumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. This is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally lags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long supplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the majority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive obligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful.1 However, in principle the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet (peace be upon him): The Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him. When he makes the takbeer, make the takbeer, when he goes into ruku\u2018, make ruku\u2018. When he says \u201csamia\u2018 Allahu li man hamidah\u201d (Allah hears he who praises Him), say \u201cRabbanaa lakal Hamd\u201d (O our Lord! To You belongs the Praise). When he goes into sajdah, make sajdah. If he prays sitting, then all should be sitting. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 689)",

What should he do? Is the prayer of the people praying behind him still valid or do they need to make up all or part of it?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the Imam enters the state that nullifies his ablution or prayer, or remembers during the prayer that he did not perform ablution, then he should come out from prayer and appoint someone from the attendees who can lead them to completion. This has been narrated from \u2018Umar, \u2018Ali, \u2018Alqamah and \u2018Ataa\u2019. If he did not appoint anyone and the people prayed individually, this would be acceptable, and this is the opinion taken by Imam Al-Shafi\u2018i. If he elected someone and advanced him to lead them, that is also permitted. The evidence for this is what has been narrated regarding \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) when he was stabbed. He took Abdur Rahman bin \u2018Auf who led the prayer to completion.1 And the reason for this deduction is that \u2018Umar did so in the presence of a number of Companions and others and no one opposed this act, so it became a consensus (ijma\u2018).2 If the Imam remembers that he is not in a state of purity, he should indicate to the followers to remain as they are and purify himself and come back to lead them. The evidence for this is the following narration of Abu Dawud from Abu Bakrah: The Prophet (sallallaahu \u2018alayhi wa sallam) entered into the Fajr prayer and indicated to the people that they should stay in their places. Then he came back to lead them and water was dripping from his head. (Sunan Abi Dawud, No. 233; Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/45) Commenting on this hadith, Imam Al-Khatabi says: In this hadith there is an evidence that if one is leading the people in prayer while in a state of impurity and the people do no know of it, then their prayer is unaffected and there is no need for them to repeat it. But the Imam has to repeat his prayer.3 If one is praying (either as Imam or follower or individually) and recalls that he had wiped over his socks during wudu\u2019 while the duration of wiping had expired, he should terminate his prayer because his ablution is incorrect. This is what has been quoted from Imams Ahmad and Al-Shafi\u2018i.4 Sahih Al-Bukhari/Fath Al-Bari, 7/60. 2 Ahkam Al-Imamah by Al-Muneef, 234, 1st Edition. 3 Ma\u2018alim As-Sunan by Al-Khatabi (Collected by Al-Da\u2018as) 1/159. 4 Al-Mughni, 2/505.",

However, if something like this happens to one of the followers behind the Imam, his prayer will be correct as long as he followed his Imam. The evidence for this is the Hadith of Abu Bakrah when he entered into the prayer in the position of ruku\u2018 and did not recite Al-Fatihah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him: May Allah increase your endeavor. You do not need to repeat. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 750) If the follower forgets to recite Al-Fatihah or is ignorant of its obligatory nature or finds the Imam in the state of ruku\u2018, then his rak\u2018ah will be considered as complete and his prayer correct. He does not need to repeat the rak\u2018ah, as he is his excused due to ignorance or forgetfulness or if he missed catching the qiyam (the position standing upright).

If he returns back to the ruku\u2018 intentionally, this action would render his prayer invalid since he added an extra rukn (pillar, or obligatory act of the prayer) which is this second superfluous ruku\u2018. However, if he did it in ignorance or forgetfulness, his prayer will not be nullified, but in this case he must make the prostration of forgetfulness if he was praying individually or leading a congregation. This is because tasbeeh (subhaana Rabbi al-Azeem, How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme, or another supplication of ruku\u2018) is wajib (required), and forgetting it makes the prostration of forgetfulness necessary.

You need to advise them that it then becomes their responsibility to spend it for a similar charitable purpose.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A women's menstrual cycle is subject to variations, such as being longer or shorter or discontinuous or delayed or coming earlier as a result of many biological and psychological factors. Therefore, the woman is not allowed to perform prayer, have intercourse with her husband, etc., until she becomes totally clean, even if her period is longer than usual, unless it exceeds 15 days.",

        "question": "What is the ruling if a woman\u2019s period lasts longer than 15 days?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If blood continues to flow and a woman is still waiting to purify herself, and it exceeds 15 days, then she should fall back to her normal period as a reference. Accordingly, she must make ghusl, and start praying, and in addition make up the prayers for the days which she did not pray since the time when her normal period would have ended. For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she was still waiting for the end of the period. In this case, she makes ghusl immediately, and starts praying, and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl. The reason for this is that the longest that a woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days according to Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388). Thus, if the flow continues past 15 days, then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered istihadah (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.) Regarding making up the missed prayers, she should pray them consecutively in order by intention, in one session, and she can rest if she gets tired. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "A woman's cycle can be as long as 15 days. If a woman's period does not exceed 15 days, it is considered \"istihadah\" or blood that flows into a woman during her period. A woman must make up all the missed prayers in one session.",

The daleel (evidence) for this is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) borrowed from the Jews and they were dealing in riba.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The sunnah is for the takbeer to be in conjunction with the movement, such that one begins the takbeer with the beginning of the movement. The daleel (evidence) for this is the hadith of Abu Hurairah in which was said: Abu Huraira used to say takbeer in all the prayers, compulsory and optional,... He used to say takbeer when standing for prayer and when bowing; then he would say, \"Sami'allahu li-man hamida,\" and before prostrating he would say \"Rabbana walaka-l-hamd.\" Then he would say takbeer when prostrating and when raising his head from the prostration, then another takbeer when prostrating (for the second time), and when raising his head from the prostration. He also would say the takbeer when standing from the second raka'a. He used to do the same in every raka'a until he completed the prayer. On completion of the prayer, he would say, \"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is! No doubt my prayer is closer to that of Allah's messenger than yours, and this was his prayer until he left this world.\" (al-Bukhari) The scholars have have understood from the Arabic word \"heena\" used in the hadith (translated here as \"when\") that the beginning of the takbeer should be in conjunction with the beginning of the movement. Note that some scholars have recommended that the saying of takbeer should extend throughout the movement, from when it starts until it ends; however, there is no daleel (evidence) for this.",
        "summary": "The sunnah calls for the sunnah to be arranged with the movement and for one to begin the prayer before it begins. The sunnah also says for the prayer to coincide with the action. The scholars have found no evidence for this, although there is some evidence for it.",

Sorry it was long question but please reply me as soon as possible.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah). This situation about which this sister is asking is a common one and occurs often as a result of a clash of desires between parents and their daughter. It could be for a benefit or interest the mother or father sees and the young woman doesnt, and each regards the issue from a different perspective or with a particular consideration. And perhaps the opinion of the parents is the appropriate and correct one as a result of their prior trials and longer experience in life, and perhaps the woman sometimes looks to the appearance of the groom more than anything else, whereas the parents may look to other considerations, such as his family status, or his long-term career or employment. Of course none of this means that the womans opinion isnt sometimes more correct and preferable, particularly when the opinion of the parents stems from a benefit they may realize if the marriage is accomplished, and they do not actually make the priority their daughter who is the most important thing in this issue. And while being vigilant in advising you of the importance of obeying ones parents and struggling with oneself to realize their wishes and desires and giving their opinion the priority, the point must clearly be made that the following two hadeeth from the Prophet (peace be upon him) must be abided by and carried out, as within them are the complete answer to your question and questions from others in similar situations: The first hadeeth: If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) pleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry him, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and vast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan Tirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih ul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to refer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the cutting off of relations among the people and relatives, and the spreading of hatred) The second: Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a young woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, My father married me to his brothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his standing among the people, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. asserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned on her approval and negated by her refusal). So she said, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I wanted women to know that fathers cannot force their will in these matters. And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn Buraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her and said, My father married me to his brothers son in order to raise his standing among the people and I am unwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the Prophet (peace be upon him) comes. So the Prophet (peace be upon him) came and she informed him of the situation, so he sent for her father and invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in the brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I have authorized and endorsed what my father has done, but I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter or not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min Sunanihi and it is sahih). I ask Allah for you success and guidance to that in which there is blessings for you and your family, and may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "question": "Is it OK for a husband to marry a second wife, without the consent of the first wife just because the man, or husband, in our case, falls in love with another woman? Should he marry her, even though he is already married? Does Islam allow such a situation for a man?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Man-woman relationship before marriage Before responding to this question, a comment must be made regarding an objectionable and reprehensible issue implied in the question, and that is the mentioning by the sister that he \u201cfalls in love with another woman\u201d. It is known that it is not permissible in the Islamic religion to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who is ajanabiyya to him (lit. foreign, i.e., marriageable) before marriage, for Allah revealed in Surat al-Maidah (the Table), ayah 5 a verse whose meaning can be translated as: \u201cThis day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste and virtuous women who are believers, but chaste women among People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).\u201d And the word \u201cakhdan\u201d that appears in this ayah (appearing above as \u201csecret intrigues\u201d) means intimate friend or companion, and in this case refers to a lover, and Allah has indicated in Surat al-Ahzab (33:53) that a condition for talking with women when it is needed is: (a translation of the meaning) \u201c...and if you ask them (women) for something you want, ask them from behind a hijab (both in the sense of a physical barrier such as a screen or wall, as well as in clothing); that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs...\u201d And Allah has commanded women not to speak with soft, sensual voices with a man who is ajnabi (lit. foreign, meaning one to whom marriage is not forbidden) so that he is not tempted by their voices, and so as not to provoke feelings of lust. Allah ta'ala said in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 32, a verse whose meaning can be translated as: \u201c... if you do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire; but utter sufficient and appropriate speech.\u201d (33:32) So how could it possibly be permissible after all of these injunctions to establish love or friendship relations among women and men who are ajanib (marriageable)? Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam And as for the original matter of the question, Allah (subhanahu wa-ta\u2019ala), Who is al-Hakim (All Wise) al-Khabir (All Experienced), and Who is more knowledgeable about the human beings He created than they themselves are about themselves, has ordained that a man is allowed to marry whom he wills among women as long as he does not bond in marriage under his care and responsibility more than four women. And this is conditioned upon him dealing justly among them the known justice specified by Shari\u2019ah which includes overnight stays and spending. If he does not have the ability and capacity to deal with such justice, then he should suffice with one, as Allah indicates in Surat al-Nisa in ayah 3, which has a meaning that can be translated as: \u201c... marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one...\u201d (4:3) And Allah\u2019s Shari\u2019ah (law) is all just and wise, and He ordains what He wills and does what He wants and it is incumbent upon as human beings to believe and have faith and submit and obey and abide by the Shari`ah, otherwise then we are not Muslims nor mu\u2019minin (believers). As Allah also said in Surat al-Nisa, ayah 65, a verse whose meaning can be translated as: \u201cBut no, by your Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction\u201d (4:65) and in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 36, a meaning that can be translated as: \u201cIt is not fitting for a mu\u2019min (believing man) or mu\u2019minah (believing woman) when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Apostle he is indeed strayed on a manifestly wrong path.\u201d (33:36) Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife? Furthermore, no evidence appears either in the Quran or sunnah requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry another wife, and therefore he is not required to ask her permission. However, he needs to be judicious in taking this decision and to weigh it carefully with respect to benefits and drawbacks and to look with the eye of wisdom at all of the considerations pertaining to the matter, and he should strive all he can to conciliate, reassure, and satisfy his first wife, in order to ease and mitigate the effect of the matter upon her.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Nisaab ul-Zakat for naqd (gold and silver) is defined as the minimum amount of naqd specified by shari\u2019a below which one is not required to pay zakat, whereas if one\u2019s wealth exceeds it then zakat becomes incumbent. And it is known that zakat ul-maal (wealth) in shari\u2019a is required for the two types of naqd\u2014gold and silver\u2014and what serves their function in modern times (commonly referred to as cash), whether it is dollars or riyals or pounds or otherwise. Nisaab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. Nisaab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. It is well known that there is a noticeable disparity between the value of nisaab for gold and that of silver in our times. The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days). If the amount reaches the value of nisaab for silver or more, then he should pay from it for every 1000 dollars, 25 dollars (i.e., 2.5%) to be spent in the prescribed benficiaries as specified by shari\u2019ah, and we ask Allah to aid us and help us succeed in haqq il-maal wa salla allahu ala nabiyyana muhammad",

And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102) I say: In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, \"and let the other party...\" There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party. Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory. This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse. Second Evidence Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as \"The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused.\" (Quran 68:42-43) The evidence here is from several facets amongst them: Allah punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate. The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadeeth of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him \"do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)\"? He said yes, then the Prophet said \"fahayhala\" which means something like \"then go answer the call.\" This hadeeth is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered. Third Evidence Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as \"Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing\". (Quran 2:43) The proof therein is: That Allah ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat. His statement which was translated as \"with those that are bowing\" is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation. B- Evidence From The Sunnah First Evidence Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said \"The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them.\" Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version. This hadeeth proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah. Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadeeth which follow: They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadeeth of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer \"I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer\". This is not in contradiction to the hadeeth of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadeeth of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning. They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge. They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement,...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors: The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation. The second: Confirming what the Messenger cancelled. For he never punished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept from them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them and Allah. As such the hadeeth of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the obligation of salat al jama'ah. Second Evidence What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, \"Oh Messenger of Allah, I do not have someone to guide me to the Mosque,\" and thus asked the Messenger to grant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, the Messenger called him and said \"Do you hear the call? \", he said \"yes\". He said, \"Then answer.\" Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by Ibn Maktoom that he said: \"Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have a guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?\" He said \"Do you hear the call?\" Ibn Maktoom replied \"Yes\". The Prophet then said \"I cannot find an excuse for you\". If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in congregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see? Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, \"This is an order to pray in congregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah\". The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive evidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about supportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory. If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply preference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying preference, and nothing would remain obligatory. Third Evidence Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the Prophet said, \"Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.\" This is a sound, and authentic hadeeth. Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat \"... and mind you this chain (referring to chain of narration of the above hadeeth) is authentic.\" This hadeeth has been narrated by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also been traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken about this hadeeth, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic word mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to the Prophet contradict their claim. That hadeeth states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and this judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order which implies preference, and not obligation. Fourth Evidence Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then let him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda (guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to establish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be abandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of your prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that purifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these mosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), and raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would be carried between two men until he is stood in the row. In another narration he said, \"the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and amongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called\". Narrated by Muslim. The evidence in this hadeeth is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of confirmed hypocrisy. It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is obligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in whose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites in their attributes. Fifth Evidence Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah said, \"If there are three let one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is the one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount memorized, and ability to recite it properly)\". Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah said \"There are not three in a town where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established amongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to jama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one\". Authentic hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmed. Sixth Evidence Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the Mu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got up from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the Masjid. Then Abu Huraira said \"as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the Messenger) \". Narrated by Muslim. Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal Qasim, and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of the sunnah of Abal Qasim. And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then he has left something which is obligatory. These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim servant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will find more and more. Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to reject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled differently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded differently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and Sunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become Imam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah. Know this because it is beneficial to you... Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the companions of the Messenger, have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no narrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. And following is what has been confirmed by them: Ibn Mas'ood said, \"and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known.\" (5th evidence) Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have stated, \"Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.\" (3rd evidence) Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: \"These are statements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is not one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of these pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one another. Verily in Allah is our success.\" These are the statements of the people of knowledge: Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3/349), \"More than one of the companions were of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is no salat for him.\" Ata'a bin Rabah said, \"There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or country side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in congregation, out of pity, he should not obey her. Al-Awza'i said: \"There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or the daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer or not.\" Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, Al-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and most of Ahl Al-Hadeeth, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i. You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning the obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as such from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.) Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is correct; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the acceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of Zaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not. We ask Allaah to help us in remembering and thanking him and better worshipping him. Allaah the exalted knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise for Allah. All praise is due to the author of this paper. The first evidence comes from the Qur'an, which explains how the Prophet decrees that people must pray in congregational prayers even though they are not supposed to. The second evidence is from the Sunnah, which states that if a person does not respond to a call to prayer, then there will be no obligation to recite the Salat al-Jama'ah unless he obtains a valid excuse. The third evidence relates to an incident in which a blind man was asked to leave the Friday prayer because he could not attend the weekly congregation prayers. The blind man had left something which was obligatory, according to the Prophet. The final evidence points to the absence of a person's valid excuse for leaving the service.",

        "question": "Is it permissible to interrupt tawaf or sa`i?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to interrupt tawaf or sa`i? If a person is performing tawaf (circumambulation around the Ka`bah) or sa`i (between Safa and Marwah), and he comes across a need (e.g., he is thirsty and wants to drink something, or loses someone from his family members and stops to look for him, or becomes tired and wants to take some rest), and if the break was short, then he may continue his tawaf from where he left off. Can you interrupt tawaf for prayer? If the prayer is called and he interrupts his tawaf to pray, the scholars have disagreed on this issue. The most conservative opinion is that when he continues his tawaf, he should not count the last round which he left incomplete. Can you take a rest in tawaf and sa`i? The issue of taking a rest in tawaf and sa`i, however, is based on the condition that tawaf and sa`i should be completed contiguously. Continuity in tawaf and sa`i In sa`i, continuity is not a requirement according to the best opinion. So, if a person is performing sa`i, and he breaks after some of the rounds, and then comes back to complete them, this would be considered permissible. However, regarding continuity of tawaf, the scholars have two opinions: That continuity is mandatory, and that a long discontinuity without due justification nullifies the tawaf. That continuity is a sunnah, and the tawaf is not nullified even though the break was long. However, it is better to act according to the first opinion. (See Fatawa Al-Hajj Wal 'Umrah by Ibn Baz, p. 80; Al Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/47 and 49; Al-Mughni, 3/414)",

        "question": "What is the distance which, once one has set out for it, allows one to shorten the prayer?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars comprising the Malikis and the Shafi\u2019is and the Hanbalis have taken the opinion that the recognized distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is four burud (an antiquated unit of distance), which is two average day's travel by heavily-loaded camels (equivalent to 88.7 km in distance). Among what they have quoted as evidence is what was authentically (sahih) narrated by Ibn \u2018Umar and Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to shorten the prayers and break fasting at a distance of four BURUD. This quoted distance is approximate and not exactly limited as per the majority of scholars, and thus what is slightly less is exempted as well. Some scholars including Ibn Qadamah and Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his pupil Ibn al-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as travel in practice and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'ah such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan. Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Quran and sunnah, as in the example of Surat al-Nisa, verses 4:101-102: \"When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.\" And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to `Umar ibn al-Khattab \"Verily Allah has said'if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure.\" 'Umar said, \"[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' \" (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.) Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn \u2018Abdullah ibn Khalid ibn Asid said to Ibn `Umar, \"How can you shorten the prayer when Allah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear',\" so Ibn `Umar said, \"O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'ahs during travel.\" (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via \u2018Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.) The verse expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically restricting the distance. Thus the Quran and sunnah mention \"travel\" and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particular case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (regarding the minimum required distance). And Allah knows best.",

They believe that travelers should prepare adequately for travel during Ramadan because it is a fasting period. Some scholars also note that some travel may not be considered as travel unless it is done in language and requires preparation. For example, one who travels in light-packed camels will need to travel at least four BURUD, which is two daily day's travel from heavilyloaded camels equivalent to 88.1 km in distance.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All praise and thanks be to Allaah the Lord of the worlds. Regarding your question about the prohibition of so-called \"libaas ul-shuhrah\" (lit. dress of high repute, i.e. to show-off or as a status symbol), there is a sound and truthful hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that Allah's messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"He who wears libaas ul-shuhra in this world will be dressed in humiliating clothes on the day of judgment.\" (narrated by Ahmed & Abu Dawood, confirmed sahih by Al Albani in Sahih Al-Jami' 6526) Those who wear libaas ul-shuhrah will be punished on the day of judgment in accordance with their deeds (as you sow, so you reap), provided that he/she meant sovereignty and supremacy upon mankind. In return, Allaah Almighty will humiliate him/her on the day of judgment and will suppress him/her to put-on such a dress for which people would despise him/her and mock at him/her (as you sow, so you reap). The question here is: \" What consists libaas ul-shurah?\" What is meant by this expression is a anything worn to show-off and to attract the attentions of others, so as to look upwards unto him/her once he/she appears wearing it. This, of course is due either to its strange colors amongst the ordinary dresses of other people or due to the stylish models or even to how precious, expensive or even to the contrary of this as being trivial and completely valueless. Hence, our righteous forefathers (may Allaah have mercy upon their souls) used to hate, disregard and even despise either extremity of the fame-clothing: i.e. those which are highly bombastic & precious and/or vise versa alike. All we wish of His All-Mighty is to grant us the righteous clothing and save us in this world and in the hereafter. Aameen.",

In response to Aameen's question regarding the prohibition on so-called 'libaasa ul-shhuhrah', which is anything worn by one to show off, to attract attention, or as an ostentatious display of wealth, there is a reliable hadith that proves that those who wear high repute will be punished for their deeds and provided that he / she means sovereignty and supremacy over mankind. The same hadith also proves that the messenger Muhammad said that anyone who wears fame-climbing will be treated with contempt on the \"day of judgment.\" Thus, those who don't adhere to this hadith are doomed to serve in vain on Judgment Day.",

It is a condition that the sin be given up immediately and that there should be true feelings of regret in the heart. This should be accompanied by the firm intention not to fall into it again.

        "question": "I have neglected many rights of Allah in the past, such as prayers, fasts, and zakah (paying poor-due). Am I required to repeat them or to compensate for them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.As far as the five daily prayers are concerned, the preferred opinion is that the repetition or compensation (or what is known as qadha in Arabic), is not obligatory for the reason that prayers are obligatory at a particular time, and once that time has elapsed, there is no way to offer them. However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible. As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less. Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation. Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting. It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting. As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right. (See Madarij Al-Salikin for further details). And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "The five daily prayers, repetition or compensation are all considered obligatory. However, the majority opinion holds that the prayers must be repeated every day for eight days and that fasting-yes is required. If a person does not fast but does not offer the zakah, then he/she will have to pay for all previous years' unpaid years' worth of fasting. Lastly, there is a minority opinion that if a person is a Muslim when it becomes obligatory, then their prayers must also be repeated in order to make up for fasting. In other words, even though prayers are obligatory, they are not obligatory because they are still valid during the past years. The only way to determine whether a person's prayers are \"required\" is to prove that his/her prayers are indeed obligatory. For example, a girl reaches puberty in the year 1300 A.H.; she did not tell anyone about her menstruation until 1400 A.h., so now she has to go back and re-fast eight days.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yes, repentance from a particular sin is acceptable even if the repentant insists on another sin which is of a different nature and not the same as the one from which he has repented. For example, if a man repents from having accepted interest but not from drinking wine, his repentance over accepting interest is acceptable, and vice versa. But if he repents from simple interest but not compound interest then his repentance is invalid. Or if he repents from taking drugs but insists on drinking wine, or vice versa, then the repentance is invalid too. It will also be incorrect and unacceptable if a man repents from adultery with one woman but commits it with another. In all of these cases they have only shifted from one variety of sin to another within the same kind. And Allah knows best.",

Perhaps another may say,\" I embezzled some money from a firm which has closed up its business.\" Or yet another person may say,\" I pilfered some material from an establishment which has shifted its premises.\" What shall I do now?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In all these cases it is incumbent upon you to search for them to the extent of your means. If you find them, return them their right. If the owner or owners have died, then their right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate them, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the reward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some way or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the Hereafter. This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin (1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from al-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him what he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander refused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that they have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking his advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each soldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is one-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic government which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth of all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give convey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan [who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is dearer to me than half of what I rule over.' Imam Ibn Taymiyya has also given a similar ruling. (See Madarij)",

In all these cases, it is incumbent on you to find them. Search for them to extent of means. Return them their rightIf they have been injured, then spend the money that Allah has given to them in order to get them back. This is an example of a soldier who stole from alghaneema during the Civil War. The soldier then went to his scholar-hajjaj, who advised him about how to return the money to the soldier whose right was one-fifth. The scholar told the man to send one fifth of what he had received in charity to the person whose right is 1-fifth",

        "question": "I have committed backbiting involving a person or a group of people, or have unjustly slandered some people regarding things with which they didn't have anything to do. Is it a condition of repentance that I should inform them and seek their pardon? And if this is not required then how do I repent?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The answer will depend on the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and seeks their forgiveness. But if the case is the opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the following manner. Evoke in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for further elucidation). You must note, dear brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause increase in distress. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "In the case of a person who has been slandered, it is okay for the perpetrator to inform the victims of what he once said or did about them. However, if the victim feels that this information will incite feelings of distress and anger, then such an action may be appropriate. If the victim does not feel that his words or actions were inordinately mean or unfeeling, then there is no point in informing the victim of what happened. In the same situation, the victim should be able to make up for all the wrongs he had done before.",

Instead, if he has a good deed in his account it will be taken away from him and given to the person he had wronged. And if he has no good deeds in his account, sins of the other person will be taken from him and added to his account\" (al-Bukhari).

Al-Khiraqi (rahimahullah) said: \"If it (nisaab al-zakaat) is reached then a quarter of 1/10 is due upon it and upon whatever exceeds it, no matter how small.\" Ibn Qadama (rahimahullah) in explaining this statement said: \"Meaning that if the amount of silver has reached 200 (which is the nisaab of silver in dirhams as has been discussed in question # 64) and the dinars 20 (which is the nisaab for gold in the units of mathaqeel [ see also question #64]) then one is obligated to pay zakaat upon it one quarter of 10 percent, as this has been established by his (the Prophet's, peace be upon him) saying 'for silver, one fourth of one tenth' \" (Al-Mughni ma'a al-sharh il-kabeer, 2/600) As for the meaning of the rest of the statement that what exceeds the nisaab no matter how small, it means that 1/4 of 1/10 (i.e. 2.5%) is also due upon this surplus difference. Thus, the overall meaning is that if monetary wealth surpasses the amount of nisaab, then zakaat is due upon it all, and not upon the surplus only, nor upon the amount of nisaab only, but on the total. Note that zakaat must be paid on the excess amount over nisaab, regardless of how small. This is the opinion taken by Malik and al-Shaafi'i and jumhoor al-ulemaa'. (see the source quoted above)",

I know that the meat needs to be slaughtered in the name of Allah, and it shall be done by the people of the book. Currently in the United States, the Christians and the Jews don't follow the true Bible and the Torah. The Christians call Isa (may Allah be pleased with him) the son of God. Is the meat cut by these people halal, can it be eaten?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah).al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). The Christians and the Jews of the People of the Book in our times are indeed those People of the Book that are mentioned in the texts of shari'ah in the Qur'an and sunnah, and they are the kuffar (unbelievers) of the Jews and Christians that existed at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). They are the people of the corrupted Torah and corrputed Injeel, as evidenced by the fact that Allah (swt) addressed them and named them \"People of the Book\" despite their being kuffar and their books being corrupted, as indicated in the following interpretations of the meanings of the aayaat: Aala 'imran: 70: O People of the Book! why do you reject the Signs of Allah, of which you are (yourselves) witnesses? Al-maa'ida: 15: O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book. Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer): It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces) These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the communists, and others. Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Maa'ida: 5 This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of several cases: That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it. That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): \" and forbidden unto you is maita\" (al-Maa'ida:3) That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow\" That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) \"and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you.\" (al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would not be permisible. That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet replied \"Mention the name of Allah upon it and eat it.\"",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can you marry your cousin? There is no objection whatsoever in the Islamic religion for a man to marry any of his relatives except al-maharim (those forbidden for marriage ) whom Allah mentioned in Surat Al-Nisa, 4:23 (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cProhibited to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (who breast-fed you), foster-sisters (who breast-fed from the same woman as you); your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives with whom you have consummated marriage, no prohibition if ye have not consummated; (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\u201d Thus, when Allah mentioned for us the relatives to whom marriage is forbidden, we then come to know that there is no objection for the remainder of the family relations. Should marrying cousins be the last resort? Furthermore, there is no condition that it be the last resort as indicated in the question. Among the most prominent evidence of this fact is that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married his daughter Fatimah to \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) and he is the son of her father's uncle, as well as the marriage of the Prophet himself to Zainab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) and she is his aunt's daughter (i.e. his cousin); and there are many other such examples. However, a different question may be asked, namely: \"Is it better or preferable for a Muslim to marry someone he is not related to rather than a relative?\" The answer to this question varies from case to case, and perhaps it may be preferable to marry people who are non-relations, for example if one aspires to form new social ties or bonds, and regards the existence of a marriage relationship with a different family as constructive in widening the circle of social bonds.

Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allaah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (al-tayyibaat, al-halaal) and evil or prohibited (al-khabaa'ith, al-haraam), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) in surat al-A'raaf (7:157): \"And He makes good things halaal for them and bad things haraam.\" Considering this fact, smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil. Thus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking. There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being. Allah said (interpretation of meaning): \"Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you.\" (Surat al-Nisaa' 4:29) In addition, His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islaam).\" (Arabic \"laa darar wa laa diraar\") He (peace and blessings be upon him) also said: \"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about... his body as to what he engaged it in.\" Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): \"Your body has a right on you.\" There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for the health of others who inhale the polluted breath of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children. The offensive smell caused by smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of Allah among humans and angels. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin.\" (Surat al-Ahzaab, 33:58) The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): \"... and do not be extravagant wasters. Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan.\" (Surat al-Israa' 17:26-27) Extravagance (in Islam) means spending on something haraam. Spending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about..... what he owned as to how he spent it.\" Considering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others. It is not permissible to indulge in it, or buy and sell it, or even to offer it to others. It is incumbent on a person who is addicted to it that he must make all efforts and get whatever necessary treatment to stop it. If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it. We ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up. Allah is the Best Guide to the Right Path.",

        "question": "I have a dear friend that has converted to Islam. I am in support of her decision. Could you explain the process of how to convert to Islam? Is it haram in Islam to date? Is there halal dating in Islam? What is the process of finding a suitable wife in Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A message of thanks Respected questioner (may Allah protect you from every evil), Please accept from me a well-intentioned greeting! I commend and appreciate your wise and mature sense of judgment in supporting your friend's decision to accept Islam. It shows admirable wisdom and a balanced sense of sagacity and understanding of this blessed event. How to embrace Islam Regarding the procedure for embracing the religion of Islam, it is actually an extremely simple process, without complication or prolongment. This is because it is something between a person and his Lord and there are no other parties involved. All that is required of a person in order to embrace Islam is that he or she pronounces the two testaments of belief in the Islamic creed, believing in their meaning, then to take a complete bath with the intention of (ritual) purification in order to start performing prayers (note to ensure complete cleanliness one should shave pubic and under-arm hair, and a man should be circumcized if he is not already--Islam places great emphasis on proper hygiene and personal cleanliness). The meaning of the shahadah As for the two testimonies of creed, the first is \"ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah\" (I testify that there is no deity other than Allah), which means that one believes and confirms that there is nothing to be worshipped other than Allah and that one is prepared to implement His divine rulings and guidelines (Shari`ah) for all aspects of life. The second is \"ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasool ullah\" which means the belief that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the seal of the prophets (i.e. the final one), whom Allah has sent with the Islamic religion to supercede all other previous religions and that it is obligatory to comply with what he has enjoined, and to abstain and renounce all that he has prohibited and restrained. Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late I tend to gather from your question that there is a degree of pondering on your part or inclination towards embracing the Islamic religion, joining the example of your friend. I would invite you to carry through with it without excessive delay and reluctance, for one does not know when one's fate will come. So why not meet one's unavoidable fate as a believer in Allah (God) and the Hereafter, a member of the religion of Islam? It is the religion which Allah has specified that He will not accept any other religion besides it, and He will not save anyone from Hell besides its followers. Undoubtedly, this step will be the greatest thing that you will ever have experienced in your life. Surely you will not regret it at all and Allah will help you to surmount the difficulties you perhaps may face in your path after accepting Islam, such as the scorn of some relatives or family members or the alientation of some friends. However, the step in fulfilling your destiny is much more important and significant than all this. We pray for you to be bestowed with grace, and may Allah guide you to success. Waiting for glad tidings in the near future, may Allah guard and protect you. For more about the pillars of Islam, please see this answer: 13569 Is dating haram in Islam? I was extremely pleased to receive your questions regarding the nature of the relationship between men and women in Islam. Regarding the issue of dating in Islam, one must first define what is meant by \"dating.\" If dating is understood to mean how a man and a woman get to know each other for the purpose of marriage, then there are certain guidelines and established procedures which can be discussed. However, if dating is understood to refer to casual relationships between men and women for the purpose of \"fun\" or \"going out\" and such, then there is no provision for this in Islam. Such a situation is not considered respectful for either the man or the woman, nor is it constructive for the concept or the building of the family or society or social responsibility. Opening the door to relationships of love and infatuation and passion and pre-marital sex is categorically prohibited in Islam. It does not lead to the establishment of a family nor to proper and virtuous upbringing of children nor to stability and mutual care and tranquility and peace of mind between a man and woman. Rather, dating leads to disorder, the disgracing of one's honor and dignity, and to a lifestyle similar to that of animals, and to that of illegitimate children who are subjected to a life of vagrancy and loss. (Please see question # 61 which addresses the issue of prohibition of pre-marital relationships). How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam As for the former case, regarding how a man and a woman come to know each other for the purpose of marriage, it varies from circumstance to circumstance. Normally if a man has the desire to marry and has the ability to accept the responsibility, and he does not have anyone in mind, he will ask his friends, family, and relatives if there is a lady that may be suitable for him and his expectations among their acquaintances and relatives. If someone is suggested, he normally asks about her extensively, about her religious observance, her personality, her knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, suitability as a wife willing to accept all the relevant responsibilities, etc. If preliminary information seems appealing, then normally she is told that there is someone interested in meeting her and she is likewise given relevant information about him. At this point, assuming the man and the woman as well as both families involved agree that there is potential, then the man usually visits the woman's family, often accompanied by members of his own. They are given the opportunity to see each other and sit and talk together, to converse modestly (but not in complete solitude) regarding whatever is relevant to making an informed judgment. The intention for this meeting should be for them to be able to make a decision whether or not they feel they are mutually suitable. Afterwards, they each evaluate their own and their families' reactions, and pray to Allah that He guides them to what is in their best interest, and to make them accept the outcome. When both sides feel comfortable and feel they know everything they need to, based on all that has been mentioned such as asking about the other person, knowing their family, meeting in person, etc., they can make a final decision whether to carry on with marriage or not. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "This is a very well-reasoned greeting from Dr. Barlow, who explains that converting to Islam is actually a simple process with no complications or prolonging. In fact, she says, it's the same as any other religion: there are no gods, no idols, and no one can worship or administer anything other than Allah. It's all between God and his creator. The only thing required is that he/she pronounces \"the two testaments\" -- belief in the doctrine of the Islamic creed and \"shahadah\" --that is, they have to recite the two tests of faith in order to \"ritual purification.\" After this, they go to their respective families for confirmation of each other's religious beliefs and practices. From there, they make an informed decision about what they want to do once they're married.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is absolutely not permissible under any circumstances in Islamic law (shari'a) of Allah, the most esteemed and exhalted, for a non-Muslim to marry a Muslim woman, as per what He has said regarding the marriage of a kafir (unbeliever) to a Muslim woman and vice versa: (interpretation of the meaning). They are not lawful (wives) for the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them... (Al-Mumtahina:10) And Allah the most esteemed and exhalted has also said (interpretation of the meaning): Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe... (Al-Baqara:221) i.e., it is not ever permissable for someone to marry his Muslim daughter or sister or any Muslim woman for whom he is a guardian to a kafir. Islam must be exhalted and cannot be subjugated, so how could a Muslim woman be put under the care of a kafir man, when the man is normally naturally in a stronger position? In such a situation he could cause her to corrupt the practice of her religion or force her into subdual by causing her to live a life of oppression with him. He could also prevent her from practicing some of her religious rites. These are among the reasons for the aforementioned ban expressed in the previous ayaat. wallahu a'lam (and Allah is the most knowledgable).",

        "question": "If a lady reverts to Islam and is married to a non-Muslim man, must she divorce this man? If he refuses to become a Muslim, can she continue to live with him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All praise be to Allah the Almighty. If a woman becomes a Muslima and her husband is a kaafir, then it becomes mandatory for her to separate from him and it is not permissible for her to remain with him in his state of shirk (disbelief), as per Allah's injunction (interpretation of the meaning): \" do not send them back to the disbelieversthey are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them\" (Al-Mumtahinah 60:10). It is her duty to invite him to Islam and to attempt to convince him via various approaches in the hope that Allah may accept her efforts and give her the great reward for his guidance through her. The prophet (peace be upon him) once told Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when he sent him to a people who were idol-worshippers: \"Invite them to Islam and inform them what is required of them, for (I swear) by Allah, that Allah guides a man through you is better than if you had humr un-na'am (a particular kind of camel which is the most sought-after wealth among the Arabs)\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath il-Baari 3009). As for the course of the marriage, and what she should do if her husband accepts Islam or doesn't, Ibn ul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: What is indicated by evidence of his (i.e., the prophet's) ruling is that the marriage is mawqoof, or in abeyance (i.e. suspension); if her husband accepts Islam before the elapsing of her 'iddah (waiting period), then she remains his wife. If her 'iddah elapses then she has the right to marry whom she pleases or if she likes she may wait (in the hope he may still accept Islam). If he then accepts Islam, she becomes his wife without need of renewing the marriage. (Zaad ul-Ma'aad, Vol 5 p.138). wallahu a'lam.

        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. If a Muslima becomes a woman and her husband does not accept Islam or refuses to accept the teachings of the al-Qahyim, then it becomes illegal for her to divorce from him. It is also unlawful for her/husband to send her back to disbeliever because they are not lawful \"wives\" for the disbelieving nor are the unbelievers lawful husbands for them. Thus, if a woman accepts Islam but does not renew the marriage, then she has no right to separate from her husband. However, she may wait in order to see if he will still accept the faith.",

I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous answer which was of a great help to our community (all thanks be to Allah). We are still have not purchased a masjid yet. We are considering an older church, with the will of Allah, we will convert it into a masjid and a school. Therefore, we are still collecting donations, which leads to my questions: Our Imam has been leading the efforts in gathering the donations from local sources and out of town resources. The Imam is on a bi-weekly salary and it is not in his contract to collect donations for the masjid. The Imam has suggested the idea of building or purchasing a masjid, and he also suggested collecting the donations.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All praises be to Allaah, Lord and Sustainer of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and upon his family and companions. Dear brothers: As-salaamu alaikum wa-rahamat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh, I ask Allah ta'ala that this message finds you all in good health and that He brings you success in all that is good. Before answering your most recent question, the following point must be made clear: Performing the duties of a mufti, a judge, an imam, a khateeb, or a mu'adhin is considered a duty of shari'ah, associated with the Hereafter, which must be rooted in one's volunteering and seeking the reward from Allah. It is not a worldly employment for profit or attaining income, and thus one cannot apply the principle of identifying a remuneration or compensation for specifically defined duties as one would do in the case of a worldly employment contract. If one cannot find those who are willing to volunteer to fill these duties without compensation, then it is permissible to arrange a payment for he who will execute these tasks and free himself up for them, since his duties as an imam or judge or mufti or similar functions may occupy his time such that he may not find the opportunity to gain his income through other means. Note that this payment is appointed for him for the purpose of freeing him up for his duties vis-a-vis shari'ah, and it is NOT a \"fee for hire\", i.e. NOT a salary compensating for work done. Thus, the correct case is that he accepts money so that he can be free to make fataawa (for a mufti), NOT that he makes fataawa so that he can make money; likewise, he accepts money so that he can be free to be an imam, NOT that he works as an imam so as to make money, etc. Both the correct and invalid cases are a means to an end; what makes one correct and the other invalid is what comprises the means and what comprises the end. The accepting of money must be the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and conduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this. Acts of worship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which he is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project. This suggestion is based on the fact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah regarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds. This category must be identified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is: those officials appointed by the khalifah of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, guarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it. Among the prerequisites required of those who collect zakaat are: that they are Muslim; that they are respected and trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not inclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the required Islamic fiqh, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able to perform the duties. It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a salary from bait ul-maal from other funds. However, the official cannot take anything from the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any gifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic ahaadeeth. If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the khalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it becomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute it to those who deserve it. Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given us a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the Islamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim countries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion of it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to administer it. Important observation: If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from bait ul-maal such as a judge (qaadi), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from the zakaat because he already has an income taken from bait ul-maal. In addition, the duties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims (see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol 6, p.188). If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being among the poor (al-fuqaraa'), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet his needs. Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not to compromise his impartiality and sincerity. And Allah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is best most correct.",

The problem is she is the eldest in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-muslim.I have tried to convert them to the islamic faith but they refused to submit to islam.As a muslim, i respect their decision but will i be doing a sin if they continued to livewith my girlfriend and I after we wed.I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not keep idols and dieties in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any other chinese) What am i supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and she has submitted to islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her parents want her to keep her original name(ie Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) \"not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)\" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: \"I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,\" by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): \"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred\" We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worship per of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissable and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.",

        "question": "Here in Singapore, the Muslims have very little, if not any, chance to participate in non-interest based transactions. What advice can you give to us who have no choice but to be involved in these transactions for our basic needs?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah: Every Muslim has to implement Islamic law, with all possible means, in all affairs, being social, economical, etc., in accordance with the verse: (interpretation of the meaning) \"Say: My prayer, my sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah\". On certain occasions Muslims may be ruled by a non-Islamic system, which makes it very difficult for them to practice their religion. Their example may be similar to that predicted by the prophet, (peace be upon him): \" There will come a day where a Muslim holding fast to his deen (religion) is like he who is gripping a hot coal\" (Al-Tirmidhi, sahih). When a Muslim is faced with such a situation, he should hold fast to the teachings of the Qur'an, keep himself within a good Muslim community, and strive his best to implement Islam, asking Allah's forgiveness for things he could not implement. Allah, the Merciful, has stated that (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allah does not require from a soul more than what it can bear\". When the situation becomes too difficult and over-bearing, a Muslim enters in a state of \"adversity\" or \"necessity\" (al-dharoorah) where unlawful things (al-mahdhooraat) become permissible. This is a great rule in Islam which reflects its mercy and appreciation to its followers. However, this issue is very sensitive as many Muslims, out of their ignorance, mistreat this rule. For example they neglect the corollary which says: \"The state of necessity should be dealt with in proportion to its measure.\" Therefore it is very important to mention the constraints and conditions under which the rule of necessity is applicable. Some of these are: That the level of harm associated with the unlawful action be less than that caused by the state of dharoorah. That the permissible degree or amount of the unlawful action he is allowed to commit be just enough to get him out of the state of dharoorah. That there is no other alternative in facing the state of dharoorah other than committing the unlawful act. That the duration of the concession be restricted to the duration of its cause. That the dharoorah is actually existing and not only anticipated or expected. When someone is faced by dharoorah and all its conditions and constraints are observed then the unlawful thing becomes lawful to him. Here are few practical examples to illustrate the above: It is permissible for the Muslim to eat from the dead animal if he finds nothing halaal to eat, and he will die if he doesn't eat It is permissible for a Muslim to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) when he is under a painful torturing that he cannot bear. It is permissible to deposit the money at the banks to save them from being lost or stolen, although that is considered to be helping the banks in their haraam interest transactions. It is permissible to enroll in car insurance (considering that most of the forms of car insurance are not acceptable in Islam) if he is in bad need to have a car and he is not allowed to drive one without insurance. It is permissible to complain to the \"civil courts\" (although they may not be implementing the Islamic law) to obtain one's rights if they is no other means to do so, provided one has the sound belief that there is no judgment except that of Allah. Since the question inquires about transactions in particular, it is worth noting the following: It is never permissible to ask for riba nor to accept it under any circumstances. Such unlawful action is not permissible under any need. Minimizing the risk, or having more convenience are not valid excuses to enter into unlawful contracts, like those involving riba. Improving the income or promoting the profits are also not valid excuses to adopt unlawful ways of earning. Let's remember that a little blessed halaal earning is better than many folds of haraam earning. Finally we have to say that it is the duty of Muslims everywhere to strive to find lawful alternatives to alleviate the state of dharoorah and save themselves from the need to adopt unlawful ways. We ask Allah to give us of His bounties what keeps us sufficed and satisfied, and not to make us in need of anyone other than Him. Ameen.",
        "summary": "the author emphasizes the importance of implementing Islamic law in all situations.

        "question": "Our extended family seem to de divided on the issue of women visiting graves. Some say it is perfectly okay and do so and some say it is not permitted and do not visit graves. Please let me know if it is permissible for women to visit graves.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Paying visits by Muslim men to cemeteries is a practice of the sunnah, and it reminds one of his destiny so that he may strive for it. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"I [once] had forbid you from visiting graves, [and I now enjoin] you to do so, so that the visit may serve as a beneficial reminder.\" (related by Muslim and others) and in the version of al-Haakim: \" for [such visits] soften the heart, bring tears to the eyes, and serve as a reminder of the Hereafter, [but be careful] not to speak forbidden expressions [i.e. while visiting].\" (Sahih al-Jaami' 4584) Concerning visits to cemeteries by women, scholars have varied opinions on this issue: it is allowed or preferred and their case is similar to that of men it is makrooh (reprehensible), which is the opinion of jumhoor ul-'ulemaa' (the majority of the scholars) it is forbidden, this one probably being the strongest opinion, as indicated by al-hadith al-sahih in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Allaah has cursed women who frequent graves,\" related by Ahmed and Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah and in one version, \"Allaah has cursed women who visit graves and those who build mosques and place lights upon them.\" (related by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa'i and al-Haakim) This condemnation would warrant the validity of the argument against women visiting cemeteries as the lawmaker (i.e. Allaah) would not condemn something that is permissible or reprehensibleonly that which is forbidden completely. Regarding what would be the reason for this condemnation, the scholars have cited two main arguments: Firstly, that women for the most part are emotionally weaker in accepting calamities and perhaps being in sight of her dear one's graves may break into wailing and loud weeping, which would be detrimental to her religious character and harmful for her body as well. Secondly, cemeteries are oftentimes isolated places which may not be safe for someone being alone, possibly exposing a woman to people of corrupt or loose moral character. In summary, the rationale behind this prohibition is that women are often not as strong emotionally in the face of calamities, and not visiting graves prevents them from the trial and from being exposed to unnecessary fitnah. Allaah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is most correct and best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. All praise be to heaven.Paying Muslim men to visit graves is a practice in the sunnah. It reminds him of his destiny, so that he will strive for it; it reminds one's heart, tears to eyes, and so on. Pays by Muslim men are permitted or preferred. Scholars have varied opinions about this issue. Some scholars favor it while others condemn it as reprehensible. However, scholars argue that women are emotionally weaker than men because they are less likely to accept calamities and not visit graves. The argument against visiting graves is based on two arguments: first, that women cannot withstand calamities like men do, and secondly, that graves are isolated places where people may not be able to expose a woman to corrupt or loose morals.",

        "question": "By Allah's mercy, many Muslims are entering Islam in America. Many Muslims change their names after accepting Islam. Some change their names to names of angels like Jibril or Mikail, etc. According to the 'aqidah of Ahl-us-Sunnah, angels are neither male nor female. If one says they are male, this is bid`ah and if one says they are female, this is kufr. So, I would like to know in light of all of this, what is the proper status of changing one's name to the name of an angel. Is it haram, makruh, mubah, etc.? Please help me with this answer for I have been asking and I have yet to receive a response. May Allah reward you for your answer! What advice would you give someone who has changed his or her name to the name of an angel?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim said in his book \"Tuhfat al-Mawdud fi Ahkam al-Mawlud\" in the second chapter under \"What is preferred among the names and what is considered reprehensible among them\" said: \u201c... and among them are the names of the angels such as Jibrail and Mikail and Israfil, it is makruh to name human beings with these names. Ash'had said: Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked regarding naming someone the name Jibril; he abhorred it and it didn't please him; al-Qai `Iyad said: \"... and others allowed it.\" Abdul-Razzak said in al-Jami' via Ma`mar: \"I said to Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman what would you say regarding a man whose name is Jibril or Mikail, and he responded, 'There is no objection.' (la bas bi-hi)\" Regarding the hadith: \"la tusammow bi-asma al-malaikah\" (\"don't name yourselves with the names of the angels \"), al-Bukhari has said that the validity of its chain of narration is questionable. This means that the hadith would not be considered sahih.\u201d (\"Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 83) In al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya most of the scholars have ruled that using the names of the angels like Jibril and Mikail is not makruh (disagreeable or reprehensible). Imam Malik, on the other hand, has ruled that it is makruh.\u201d (Al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya, al-Kuwait, Vol 11:334) Some have stated that the meaning of Jibril is Abdullah and likewise Mikail. See Tafsir Ibn Kathir under verses numbers 97-98 in Surat al-Baqarah. Thus, based on what has been presented, it is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers. The most preferred names, no doubt, are \u2018Abdullah and \u2018Abdul-Rahman as has been related in the sound hadith. And Allah knows best.",

If the Muslim woman is living in a place where there are no Muslims of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah with whom she could live and she is therefore unable to learn her religion, it is permissible for her to move to another place where she can live among Ahl al-Sunnah and learn her religion.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allah the Almighty. It is mandatory that a divorced woman stay in her husband's home during the period of iddah (specifically after the first and second divorce). It is not permissible for her husband to force her out of the home. The verse from the Qur'an which asserts this is al-Talaaq (65:1), (interpretation of the meaning): \"... and do not force them out of their homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in the case where they are guilty of open illegal sexual intercourse...\" The husband is also obliged to provide for her during this period of iddah, as she is still under his guardianship ('isma). It is permissible for the woman to beautify herself for her husband during the iddah. In fact, one of the reasons for iddah is to provide a period of reflection and contemplation, so each party may consider the consequences and review the decisions and circumstances, so as to provide a chance for them to get back together. If the husband abandons the house or forces the wife out, then the reasons for which Allah has ordained this period have been missed. Thus, it is incumbent upon the husband to beware of this, as he would be disobeying a command from Allah. There is nothing wrong with her going out of the house for visits, etc., with his permission, just as before her divorce. Regarding the length of the iddah, please refer to question #31. May Allah guide us to the right path.",
        "summary": "If a divorced woman is living with her husband, she is obligated to stay in his or her husband's house during this period. This period is the time when each party can consider the consequences of the decisions they have made and review the circumstances that have led them to this point. For example, it is not legal for a married woman to leave the house unless she is guilty of \"open illegal sexual intercourse.\" It is also not legally possible for her to go out and visit her husband without his permission. If the couple abandons their marriage, then there are no reasons for Allah to have ordained this period of mourning. However, if the couple were ever together, then the reason for which Allah had ordained this Period of Idah has been missed.

When the praying person is the leader in the prayer or praying alone, and he has a sutrah( some object like a peice of wood) in front of him, then walking across in between him and his sutrah is not permitted. However, if he is praying without a sutrah, it is not permissible to walk across in between him and his place of prostration.

Most of those who follow him will be Jews. He will meet his end at the hands of \u2018Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) who will kill him with a spear in Lod, which is in Palestine. Gog and Magog Yajuj and Majuj are two disbelieving tribes from among the sons of Adam. They have wide faces and small eyes. They used to spread mischief on earth, so Allah gave Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn the power to build a barrier to detain them. They will keep on digging at it until Allah gives them permission to come out at the end of time, after \u2018Isa (peace be upon him) has killed the Dajjal.

        "question": "What is the ruling on having the word \u201callaah\u201d and the word \u201c muhammad \u201d written in an interwoven fashion on the door of a mosque?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Among what the Islamic shari\u2019ah asserts is the binding and coupling of the testimony of oneness for Allah and the testimony of the calling and message of prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it. Additionally, in a hadith the prophet (peace be upon him) teaches: \u201cIslam was built upon five pillars: to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah....\u201d It represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for one\u2019s actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shari\u2019ah, starts at puberty) is required to believe. It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief. As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As a result, there is great danger in this. For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity. Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence. In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet and worshipping him with Allah. Therefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented. It is even not permissible to write (Allah - Muhammad) on the door of the masjid, nor in other locations, due to the confusion, misrepresentation, and serious concerns described and warned of above.",
        "summary": "The shari'ah asserts that there can be no god except Allah and Muhammad, and that the prophet has delivered the message.

        "question": "A man lives within a community that commits shirk (polytheism) by appealing for help from other than Allah. Is he allowed to pray with them with their leading the prayer? Is it obligatory to abandon them? Is their Shirk considered shirk al-akbar (great and serious act of disbelief by associating other beings with Allah\u2019s supremacy)? Is alliance with them treated the same as alliance with true non-believers?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the condition of those with whom you live is as you mentioned, appealing for help from other than Allah, such as appealing for help from the dead and the non-living or the trees or stones or planets and the like, then they are committing the greatest shirk which causes expulsion from the community and faith of Islam. It is not allowed to ally with them just as it is not permissible to ally with non-believers. Praying behind them is not valid. It is not allowed to mix socially with them nor to reside amongst them except for the one who calls them to the truth with knowledge, and sees hope that they will accept and that their religious condition will become correct due to his efforts. Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for him to abandon them and to join a different community in which he can work with on establishing the fundamentals of Islam and its branches and reviving the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). If he is not able to find the proper community, he should seclude himself from all communities, even if he experiences harshness, as has been related by Huthaifa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \u201cThe people used to ask the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) about goodness. And I used to ask him about evil from fear of falling in it. So I said, O Messenger of Allah, we used to be in ignorance and evil but Allah gave us this goodness, so is there evil after this goodness? He said: \u201cYes\u201d. So I said is their goodness after this evil? He said \u201cYes and it has some darkness\u201d I said what is its darkness? He said: \u201cA people following an example other than my example and calling to a guidance other than my guidance; you would agree with some of what they do and disagree with some.\u201d So, I said is there any evil after that goodness? He said: \u201cYes, callers on the doors of Jahanam (the Hellfire); whoever answers their call to it are thrown in it.\u201d So, I said: O Messenger of Allah describe them to us. He said: \u201cThey are from amongst us and they speak with our tongues\u201d I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do if this happens in my time. He said: \u201cAdhere to the community of Muslims and their leader.\u201d So, I said: What if there weren\u2019t a community of Muslims nor a leader? He said: \u201cThen seclude yourself from all the communities, even if you were to bite on the root of a tree until death\u201d Mutafaqun alayh (lit. agreed upon, i.e. narrated by both Muslim and Bukhari).

        "question": "Assalamu'alaikum. I am very in love with my girlfriend, a Chinese non-Muslim.We've been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-Muslim.I have tried to convert them to the Islamic faith but they refused to submit to Islam. As a Muslim, I respect their decision but will I be doing a sin if they continued to live with my girlfriend and I after we wed. I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not keep idols and deities in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any other Chinese) What am I supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and she has submitted to Islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her parents want her to keep her original name(i.e. Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) \"not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)\" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: \"I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,\" by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): \"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred\" We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worshipper of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissible and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.",

        "question": "In America there is a mosque which consists of three levels or floors. The top floor is the women\u2019s prayer hall, the floor beneath it is the main prayer hall, and the floor beneath that is a kind of basement, in which there are washrooms, a room for Islamic magazines and publications, and classrooms for women; there is also an extra place for women to pray.Is it permissible for menstruating women to enter this lower level?Also, there are pillars in the mosque which interrupt the rows of worshippers, splitting a row into two halves. Does this break the row or not?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the building you describe was intended as a mosque, and the people on the higher and lower floors can hear the voice of the Imaam, then the prayer of all of them is valid. In this case it is not permissible for menstruating women to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer in the lower level, because it is part of the mosque. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cI do not make the mosque permissible for menstruating women and those in a state of ritual impurity.\u201d As for a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some purpose, as long as she takes care to ensure that no blood leaks, then there is nothing wrong with this, because All\u00e2h says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer)... when you are in a state of Janaabah (i.e., when you are in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or when passing through a mosque)...\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:43] And it was reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told \u2018Aa\u2019ishah to fetch his prayer rug from the mosque, and she said that she was menstruating. He SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her: \u201cYour menstruation is not in your hand.\u201d But if it was not the intention of those who established this mosque that the lower floor was to be part of the mosque, but it was to be a storeroom or to serve some other purpose, as mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the rulings governing mosques. It is permissible for menstruating woman and those who are in a state of impurity to sit there. There is nothing wrong with praying there in the places that are pure (taahir) and are not part of the washrooms, as it is permissible to pray in all clean places where there is no shar\u2019i reason not to pray. But anyone who prays there cannot be considered to be following the imaam who is praying on the upper floor, if he cannot see him or any of the people who are praying behind him, and because this is not a part of the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion. With regard to the pillars which interrupt the rows, they do not adversely affect the prayer, but if it is possible to form the rows in front of or behind the pillars so that the row will not be interrupted, this is better. And Allaah is the source of strength.",

        "question": "Some folowers of Islam tell me that Muhammad and Jesus were two of the great prophets.

Well, Jesus was born after the Old Testiment was written, yet there were over 600 prophesy's in the Old Testiment about Jesus that all came true, yet there are NO prophesy's about Muhammad in the entire Bible. How can Muhammad be like Jesus if that is true?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is one of two cases: either this man is ignorant and what he says is of no significance, or what he says is a fabrication and a lie. We Muslims know well the aayah (Qur\u2019aanic verse) in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThose who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John, xiv 16), \u2014 he commands them for Al-Ma\u2018roof (i.e. Isl\u00e2mic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At\u2010Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al\u2010Khabaa\u2019ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah\u2019s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur\u2019aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful [al-A\u2019raaf 7:157] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: \u201c \u2018Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)\u2019 \u2013 this is a description of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the books of the Prophets who gave their nations the glad tidings of his coming and commanded them to follow him. This description is still there in their books and their scholars and rabbis know it. Imaam Ahmad narrated: Ismaa\u2019eel told us from al-Jareeri from Abu Sakhr al-\u2018Aqeeli, a man from among the Bedouin told me, I brought a milch-camel to Madeenah during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I had sold her, I said, \u201cLet me meet this man [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] and listen to him.\u201d I met him walking between Abu Bakr and \u2018Umar, and I followed them until they came to a Jewish man who was reading from a scroll of the Torah, consoling himself for the plight of his son who lay dying, a boy who was very handsome and good looking. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, \u2018I ask you by the One Who revealed this Torah, do you find any mention in this book of yours of my attributes and my coming?\u2019 The man gestured with his head to indicate \u2018No\u2019. But his son said, \u2018Yes indeed, by the One who revealed the Torah, we do find mention of your attributes and your coming in our book, and I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that you are the Messenger of Allaah.\u2019 [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, \u2018Keep this Jew away from your brother.\u2019 Then he took care of shrouding him and praying [the funeral prayer] over him.\u201d This is a qawiy jayyid hadeeth. It was narrated that \u2018Ataa\u2019 ibn Yassaar said: \u201cI met \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Amr and said, \u2018Tell me about the attributes of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described in the Torah.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, by Allaah he is described in the Torah as he is described in the Qur\u2019aan (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cVerily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner\u201d [al-Fath 48:8] \u2013 and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; you are not harsh and aggressive; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.\u2019\u201d \u2018Ataa\u2019 said: \u201cThen I met Ka\u2019b (who was one of the People of the Book who had become Muslim) and I asked him about that, and he told me exactly the same, not even one letter was different...\u201d Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that \u2018Ataa\u2019 ibn Yassaar said: \u201c I met \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said, \u2018Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Torah. He said, \u2018\u2018Yes, by Allaah, he is described in the Torah in some of the same terms as he is described in the Qur\u2019aan (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cVerily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner\u201d [al-Fath 48:8] \u2013 and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; he is not harsh and aggressive, and he does not make a noise in the market-place; he does not repay evil with evil, rather he overlooks and forgives; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.\u2019\u201d (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2125) Allaah did not send any Prophet without taking from him the covenant and promise that if the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were to appear during his lifetime, he would follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says in Soorat Aal \u2018Imraan (which no Christian reads with an open mind but he will become Muslim) (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: \u2018Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.\u2019 Allaah said: \u2018Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?\u2019 They said: \u2018We agree.\u2019 He said: \u2018Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).\u2019\u201d [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:81] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: It is said that Allaah took the covenant from the Prophets that they would confirm one another, and He commanded them to believe in one another. This is the meaning of believing and helping (\u2018you must, then, believe in him and help him\u2019)... Taawoos said: Allaah took the covenant from the first Prophets that they would believe in the Message of the later Prophets... The Messenger here is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the view of \u2018Ali and Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them). Allaah took the covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if they met him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from their nations.

Secondly, saying al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allaah) when coming out of rukoo is a well-known phrase of dhikr which is proven in sound ahaadeeth reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). All that this Sahaabi did was to come up with a new phrase expressing praise to Allaah. How can this be used as evidence to support innovations in worship and dhikr that have no basis in the sources of Islam? Thirdly, what this Sahaabi did cannot be taken as evidence in and of itself. It was not even considered to have been a correct action until after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had approved it, and not before. But how on earth could this innovator obtain the approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he has passed away?\" Fourthly, if we accept the use of this report as evidence, it is still no more than an isolated incident which cannot be generalized, whereas the hadeeth every bidah is a going astray is clearly a general statement. It is a well-known principle among the ulamaa (scholars) that what is stated clearly takes precedence over what is merely implied. Fifthly, how can we know what is good or not with our limited minds alone and without the input of Revelation? Is there not the possibility of differences of opinion? What one person sees as good will be seen differently by another, so what would the standard be? Whose reasoning could we rely on or refer to? Would this not be confusion, even anarchy itself? Sixthly (which confirms the third point made above), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of an act of worship or a dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) on the part of one of his Sahaabah, it would thus become a part of shareeah and hence be regarded as a sunnah hasanah. But with the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the ceasing of Revelation, how can we know whether innovated acts of worship or dhikr are correct or would be approved? We have no way of knowing, so we should limit ourselves only to the forms of worship that have been narrated in sound reports. The great scholar al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated many comments by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Fath al-Baari; he agreed with some and disagreed with others. This is the business of the scholars: they discuss and debate with one another, with the aim of reaching the truth which may lie with the one who is disagreeing or with the one whose opinion is being criticized. As for the unpleasant comment quoted in the question, from what we know of Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) and his good manners, fear of Allaah, awareness of the value of knowledge and respect for the scholars, we are sure that this comment is a fabrication. May Allaah forgive all the scholars and reward them for their efforts and concern.",
        "summary": "This chapter is full of praise and thanks to the \"Lord of the Worlds\" for his truthful interpretation of the prophecies. The author believes that there can be no doubt in the minds of scholars that innovations in worship, dhikr, or innovation do not always follow the Prophet's wishes. In fact, some scholars believe that innovation may sometimes go astray, while others claim that innovation often follows the rules of the sunnah. Thus, the author feels that this commentary is fabricated. May Allaah be merciful to all the scholars who work on this issue.",

        "question": "This question abouh fiqh : harakah. Can you tell me the characteristic of jamaah Islam that we must follow?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is the Muslim\u2019s duty to follow the truth and to join the victorious group, the people of Sunnah and Jamaa\u2019ah (Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jamaa\u2019ah) who are followers of the pious predecessors (al-salaf al-saalih), loving them for the sake of Allaah whether they are in his own country or elsewhere, and cooperating with them in righteousness. The attributes of the victorious group are related in a number of saheeh ahaadeeth, for example: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u201cMy ummah is an ummah which carries out the commands of Allaah; those who let them down or differ from them do not harm them and they will keep adhering to this path until the Day of Judgement.\u201d Mu\u2018aawiyah and \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with them) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u2018A group of my ummah will continue victoriously adhering to the truth until the Last Hour begins.\u2019\u201d Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu\u2018bah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u201cI heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) say: \u201cSome people of my ummah will remain victorious over the people until the decree of Allaah reaches them.\u201d \u2018Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u201cA group of my ummah will continue fighting for the truth, and will prevail over those who oppose them, until the last of them will kill al-Maseekh al-Dajjaal (the Liar or Anti-Christ).\u201d From these ahaadeeth we may understand the following: (1) The Prophet\u2019s words \u201cA group of my ummah will continue...\u201d indicate that this is a section of the ummah, not the entire ummah. This also indicates that there will be other groups and sects. (2) His words \u201cthose who oppose them will not harm them\u201d indicate that there will be other groups who oppose the victorious group in the way they practice the religion. This also concurs with the hadeeth which describes the ummah being divided into seventy-two groups or sects who oppose the one group that is following the truth. (3) Both ahaadeeth offer glad tidings to the people who are following the truth. The hadeeth that speaks of the victorious group speaks of their victory in this world. (4) The words \u201cuntil the decree of Allaah reaches them\u201d refer to the wind or breeze that will come and take the soul of every believing man and woman. This does not contradict the hadeeth \u201cA group of my ummah will remain victoriously supporting the truth until the Day of Resurrection,\u201d because that hadeeth means that they will continue to follow the truth until that gentle breeze takes their souls just before the Day of Resurrection, when many other Signs of the Last Hour have already manifested themselves. The characteristics of the victorious group From the ahaadeeth quoted above, and other reports, we can derive the following characteristics of the victorious group: (1) They follow the truth. They are described variously as \u201cfollowing the truth,\u201d \u201cfollowing the commandments of Allaah,\u201d \u201cfollowing the true religion,\u201d etc. All of these phrases indicate that they are adhering to the true religion with which Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent. (2) They obey the commandments of Allaah, which means: (a) They are distinguished from the rest of mankind by carrying the banner of Da\u2019wah towards Allaah. (b) They undertake the mission of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. (3) They will be victorious until the Last Hour. The ahaadeeth say that \u201cthey will be victorious until the decree of Allaah comes,\u201d \u201cthey victoriously support the truth,\u201d or \u201cthey will be victorious over those who oppose them.\u201d This victory includes: Being open and not hiding: they are well-known and prominent and have the upper hand. Adherence to true religion, righteousness, following Allaah\u2019s commands and fighting against His enemies in jihaad Victory by defeating others (4) They are patient and resist others with patience. Abu Tha\u2018labah al-Khashani (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u201cAfter you there will come days of patience, in which the patience required will be like having to hold a burning coal in one\u2019s hand.\u201d Who are the people of the victorious sect? Al-Bukhaari said: \u201cThey are the people of knowledge (the scholars).\u201d Many scholars said that the victorious group is the scholars of hadeeth. Al-Nawawi said: \u201cIt is possible that this group is scattered among all types of believers. Some may be brave fighters, or fuqahaa\u2019, or scholars of hadeeth, or ascetics, or people who enjoin good and forbid evil, and other types of good people.\u201d Al-Nawawi also said: \u201cIt could be a group of different types of believers, including those who are brave and skilled in warfare, faqeehs, scholars of hadeeth, Qur\u2019aanic commentators (mufassireen), those who enjoin good and forbid evil, ascetics and devoted worshippers.\u201d Ibn Hajar, may Allaah have mercy on him, explained the matter as follows: \u201cThey do not have to all be in one city; they could be gathered in one country or dispersed across the world. They may be gathered in one city or in a part of it. It is possible that one group may exist, then disappear, then be replaced by another group, and so on, until the Day of Judgement, when all will disappear except for one group in one city, who will disappear when the breeze decreed by Allaah comes.\u201d The scholars\u2019 discussion of this group does not specify one type of people, or one city or country, except for the last group, which will be in al-Shaam (the territory comprising modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine) and will fight the Dajjaal, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said. No doubt those who are involved with the sciences of sharee\u2019ah \u2013 \u2018aqeedah, fiqh, hadeeth and tafseer, studying and teaching \u2013 are the people who are most qualified to be called the Victorious Group, and they should be at the forefront of da\u2019wah and jihaad, and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and refuting the people of bid\u2019ah, all of which must be accompanied with sound knowledge based on the Wahy (Revelation). We ask Allaah to make us among them. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "question": "If you are traveling and you are shortening your prayers, is the witr prayer still wajib?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars assert that witr prayer is a confirmed sunnah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) practiced consistently, and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith regarding the Bedouin who once came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asking about Islam, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) answered, \"Five prayers within one day-and-night.\" The Bedouin asked, \"Am I obliged to other than those?\" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, \"(not) Unless you volunteer of your own.\" (Agreed upon) Some scholars have said that qiyam al-layl (prayer at the heart of night) and witr prayer are the best of the voluntary prayers. Therefore, one should consistently practice them and not neglect them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not neglect the prayers during the night nor two rak`ahs before Fajr neither in residence nor in travel as reported in authentic hadiths. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. The majority of scholars interpret the ad-hoc hadith as saying witr prayer, a voluntary prayer, is a \"sunnah,\" that the Prophet did not neglect during the night or two rakahs before fajr nor in residence and thus does not constitute an obligatory prayer.",

        "question": "How many adthans are there for fajr? If people are in the mosque do you still say \"prayer is better than sleep\" I heard it is a biddah to do this. Apparently there is a hadith to this effect. Could you send something?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There were two calls for salaat ul-fajr (prayer) at the time of Allaah's Messenger (peace be upon him), the first just before dawnfor those who are awake performing night prayers( Qe iaam Al-lyl) so as for them to either rest for Fajr or have food if they intend to fast the next day, and for those who are asleep in order they may begin to arouse and be ready for Fajr( since it is preferred as early as possible)and the second at the actual time of fajr to indicate the appropriate time and to call people to the prayer, among other benefits of the adhaan. Regarding the second point, jumhoor al-'ulemaa' (majority of the scholars) agree that the statement (within adhaan for fajr) \"prayer is superior to sleeping\" should be said in the second call to prayer. Hence, the caller or mu'athin should adhere to the saying phrase and recite it even if people are inside the mosque. It contains benefits which might be slip one's mind. Moreover, it reminds people of the very fact: \"prayer is superior to sleep\" which concerns the immediate day as well as all forthcoming days. Muslims benefit from it even when they are already in the mosque and gain the reward of repeating it after mu'athin, as per the saying of the Prophet : \"If you hear al-Mu'athin, say [i.e, repeat] as he says\" which is hadith sahih. Perhaps women and children who live near the masjid may benefit as well, and even the Muslims among the jinn. Additionally, there may be some people who feel sleepy inside the mosque or those who have nodded off while sitting. Thus, Muslims should preserve and practice this sunnah and not abandon it. May Allaah make us all successful in following the sunnah and vigilant in adhering and preserving it.",
        "summary": "The sunnah is timeless, and it should be adhered to even though people are outside the mosque performing night prayers. The call to prayer is made every morning at 5:00 a.m., and it is followed throughout the day. It is important to remember that this is the time of the year when the sunnah was first formulated. The calls for prayer are made before dawn, early in the morning, and later in the evening. The caller or muathin should follow the saying phrase \"salaat ul fajr\", which contains benefits such as slipping one's mind away from the fact that prayer is superior to slept. Also, they should repeat the prayer phrase even if no one is inside the mosque because it reminds one of the importance of prayer.",

        "question": "For a great time now my community and I have been concerned with the issue of foods such as Gelatin, mono and dyglycerides, pepsin and rennetAll these thing are in our foods today and yet we do not know what we can eat and the reason for each. PLease give me a very detailed response that could end this trouble.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has blessed His slaves by creating for them all kinds of provision on earth, and He has permitted them to eat from that which is halaal (permissible) and good; this includes very many things, it is not limited. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy.\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:168] Allaah forbids a limited number of foods, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSay (O Muhammad): \u201cI find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaah\u2019s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:145] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs, and every bird which has talons. (Narrated by Muslim, 6/60) And he forbade the flesh of (domestic) donkeys (narrated by al-Mukhari in al-Fath, no. 4215). Of the foods which are to be found nowadays, some of them are clearly haraam, such as dead meat [from an animal which has died naturally as opposed to being slaughtered properly] and pork. Some foods may contain ingredients and derivatives which come from haraam sources, so we have to find out where they come from so that we may know what the ruling is concerning them. The gelatin which was mentioned in the question may originate from the skin, muscles and bones of haraam animals such as pigs. Hence gelatin which is derived from collagen which comes from pigs is haraam, because it is as if the pig had been turned into salt. The most correct view is that it is haraam even if it has been changed, so long as it originally came from a pig, which is haraam. The fats which are used in foods come either from vegetable sources or animal sources. If they come from vegetable sources they are halaal, so long as they have not been mixed with anything that is impure (najjis) or anything that could contaminate them. If they come from animal sources, they are either from animals that we are permitted to eat or animals that we are not permitted to eat. If they come from an animal that we are permitted to eat, then they come under the same ruling as the meat of that animal. If they come from an animal which it is haraam for us to eat \u2013 such as pigs \u2013 then we look at whether they are used in foods or for other purposes. If they are usedfor non-food purposes, e.g. many fats are used in making soap, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion, but the most correct view is that they are haraam. If they are used in foods, e.g., pig fat (lard) is used in making sweets and other foods, this is haraam. With regard to cheese: if it is made from the milk of an animal which we are not permitted to eat, then according to scholarly consensus it is not permissible to eat it. If it is made from the milk of an animal which we are permitted to eat, and it is known that it is made with rennet that has been derived from an animal slaughtered according to sharee\u2019ah andit has not been mixed with any najaasah (impurity), then it may be eaten. If it was made with rennet derived from dead meat, there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether we may eat it, but the most correct view is that it is haraam. If it was made with rennet from a source which is inherently naajis (impure), such as rennet derived from pigs, then it should not be eaten. See Ahkaam al-At\u2019imah fi\u2019l-Sharee\u2019ah al-Islamiyyah by al-Tareeqi, p. 482 In many cases these matters are unclear to the Muslim (he does not know the source of food ingredients). In this case, it is better to fear Allaah and be cautious. Avoiding doubtful things may be preferable to using them in these circumstances, as stated in the hadeeth narrated by al-Nu\u2019maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say \u2013 and al-Nu\u2019maan pointed to hisears \u2013 \u201cThat which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain, and between the two of them there are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allaah\u2019s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it is sound, all the body issound and which, if it is corrupt, all of it will be corrupt. Truly it is the heart.\u201d (Narrated by Muslim, 1599). From the above we learn that the basic principle concerning food is that it is halaal, apart from those things for which there is clear evidence (daleel) that they are haraam, such as dead meat, blood, animals sacrificed to other than Allaah and meat over which the name of Allaah was not pronounced at the time of slaughter. Concerning the foods mentioned in the question: if it is proven that they contain ingredients derived from haraam sources, it is necessary to avoid them, otherwise they need not be avoided. If you are not sure whether they contain anything haraam or not \u2013 without being paranoid or succumbing to the waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan) \u2013 then it is preferable to avoid them as a precaution out of fear of Allaah. And Allaah knows best.",

Allaah says that there are only a few foods that can be eaten. For example, dead meat, dead pigs, dead bacon, and pork are all haraam; for other foods, such as cheese, it is illegal. The basic principle of food is clear: it is \"halaal\". It is preferable not to eat these foods because they contain ingredients from haraams sources.",

        "question": "The question is regarding the unsureness of the number of rakaats ones prayed. How would we go about correcting it. Some say at the end of prayer you say salam once and go into sujdah and others say you finish your prayer and than do the sujdah. This issue is very confusing please explain.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The prostration of forgetfulness (sujood ul-sahw) is required whenever one inadvertently adds extraneous parts or misses parts or is in doubt regarding parts of the arkaan (essential pillars) of the prayer and/or its other requirements. The question posed regards what to do when in doubt regarding the number of raka\u2019aat prayed, and the answer is covered in the following points: First, definition of doubtfulness: when two possibilities are equally probable without knowing or feeling one is more likely true than the other. Second, when one doubts after performing salaam: One should disregard such doubt. For example, take the case of one who has completed praying dhuhr then questions after finishing the prayer, \"Did I really pray four raka\u2019aat or only three?\" Such doubt should be disregarded completely unless it is substantiated by clear and certain indications; otherwise, it opens the door to waswasah (the whispering of Satan) and unwarranted extraneous additions to the prayer. Third, when one doubts during the prayer; this must fall into one of the following two cases: One can discern that one of the two possibilities about which one is in doubt is more likely or more certain by virtue of one\u2019s prevalent feeling or most likely inclination: In this case, one should act according to his best assumption and perform the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. The evidence for this opinion is what was related by Ibn Mas\u2019ood, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed either an extraneous addition or missed an essential part of the prayer (one of the narrators of the hadeeth was in doubt which). After saying \u2018salaam,\u2019 it was said to him, \"Oh Prophet of Allah, has there been a new change in [the way of performing] the prayer?\" He replied, \"Why [would you say that]?\" They responded, \"You prayed in such and such manner.\" So he bent his legs and faced towards the qiblah and performed two prostrations then performed tasleem (saying \u2018salaam\u2019 to the right then the left). After facing towards us, he said, \"If something new had been introduced regarding the prayers, I would have informed you about it. To the contrary, I am but a human like you I forget as you forget, so if I forget, remind and inform me. If any of you doubts during his prayer then he should try to discern the more certain and correct case, then complete the prayer based upon it, then perform tasleem, followed by two prostrations.\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath Al-Baari #401). One cannot discern nor is there any prevalence apparent to indicate which of the two cases is more certain: In this case, one should assume the least of the two and continue based on this assumption, then perform the two prostrations of doubt before tasleem. An example of this would be one who while praying the dhuhr prayer is completely uncertain whether he has completed three or four raka\u2019aat and cannot determine which is more true. Thus, he would assume the lesser of the two, i.e. three, and complete another raka\u2019ah then sit for the tashahhud, then prostrate two prostrations before saying \"salaam.\" The basis for this ruling is the hadeeth related by Abu Sa\u2019eed Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, in which he said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"If any of you doubts during his prayer and he does not know how many [raka\u2019aat] he has prayed, whether it is three or four, then he should discard and cast away his doubt. He is to continue upon what one is sure of [i.e. the lesser] then perform two prostrations before making tasleem. If he ends up [in reality] praying five [raka\u2019aat], then his prayer will be an intercession for him; and if he ends up completely the [requisite] four [raka\u2019aat] then it is targheeman for shaytaan.\" (targheeman: i.e., a way of vexing Satan and humiliating and debasing him, as well as rejecting him as a result of his failure to achieve his desire of disturbing the worshipper.)

        "question": "Can muslims accept donations from non-muslims to use in Islamic Cause?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) gave one of the chapters in his Saheeh the title of \u201cBaab qabool al-hadiyah min al-mushrikeen (Chapter on accepting gifts from the polytheists),\u201d under which heading he listed a number of ahaadeeth indicating that this is permitted. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented: \u201cOn this topic, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi narrated from \u2018Ayyaad ibn Himar [??] who said: \u2018I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a gift of a she-camel. He asked me, \u201cHave you become Muslim?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cI have been forbidden to accept the gifts of the mushrikeen.\u201d\u2019 Then al-Haafiz (may Allaah have mercy on him) quoted some of the comments made by the scholars to reconcile the texts which indicate that such gifts should be refused with those which indicate that they should be accepted. (The scholars said that) gifts should be refused when the intention behind them is to win the Muslim over (by softening his heart towards them), and they should be accepted when by doing so there is the hope of befriending that person and opening his heart to Islam. There is nothing wrong with accepting unsolicited gifts and donations from non-Muslims, and it is permissible to spend them on Islamic projects and in other ways. But asking for donations from non-Muslims carries several risks, such as being humiliated in front of them or being controlled by them. If there is no danger of such things happening, there is nothing wrong with asking. When he was still in Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to ask for help for the sake of da\u2019wah, without any humiliation involved, from some of the mushrikeen, such as his uncle Abu Taalib and others. There is no humiliation involved in putting out charity boxes or circulating flyers giving account numbers for donations, and so on. And Allaah knows best.",

Thank You",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. Muslims must realize that the age of living estranged (religiously) in non-Muslim societies effects the proliferation of the haraam and the diminishment of the halaal. It is very possible what you have suggested is true, since the business sector specifically is more involved in interest than those in the government sector. However, I do not think that this cannot be generalized as a matter of principle in this matter. In general, we can say that it is permissible for the muslim to work in any sector as long as the work there involves halaal activities, and that it is not permissible to work in any occupation or position in any sector which would involve the Muslim in a function that is muharram.

So long as a woman adheres to these conditions, she may wear whatever she likes in public places and elsewhere, and her hijaab will be considered Islamic. These conditions may be summarized as follows: The hijaab must cover her entire body It should be thick enough to conceal what is underneath it It should be loose-fitting, not tight It should not be so attractive as to call men\u2019s attention to it It should not be perfumed It should not be a dress of fame and vanity (i.e., it shouldn't be extravagant or excessively opulent) It should not resemble the dress of men It should not resemble the dress of kaafir women It should not be adorned with any crosses or pictures of animate beings Further discussion of each of the above points will appear soon, in sha Allaah.",
        "summary": "The scholars have decided on the \"hijaab\"covering -- or, in this case, what Muslim women should wear in public and in public--as a woman who adheres to the strict standards set forth by the scholars. The scholars agree that a woman must be able to put on a good show in front of men, even if she is wearing loose-fitting clothing.",

        "question": "If you are a minor and your parents earn income that might be haram for example they service businesses among them are bars, and deal with interest like when paying deposits on a apartments they rent out. My question is that there is I think (several hadith) where it says that Allah does not accept du'as and prayers of those who get there sustenance through haram means. If a little of the sustenance (money) is from haram means, and you are a minor in this case does hadith count in your case?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Expenditure is obligatory upon a father to his son/daughter according to the Islamic law and shari'ah, as regards his/her housing, clothing, food, drink and the like. However, the concept is not tied to being a \"minor\" in the sense of Western laws. The requirement according to Islamic shari'ah are: that the person spent upon is poor or does not own anything, or does not own or possess what is enough for his requirements and is unable to gain their own income. that the one spending has enough wealth to spend on himself and his wife. that the one spending and the one spent upon are of the same religion. When the son/daughter is in need for expenses, then he/she is allowed to take from his/her father's earning even though it is haraam (forbidden). In such a case his/her du'aa' to Allaah won't be affected, since being a minor, he/she has neither might nor power. But while doing so, he/she should abide by the following observations: Not to expand and widen the scope of taking or accepting from his/her father's illegitimate earnings. He/she should try if he/she is able to earn a halaal income to become independent and self-sufficient and no longer in need of the father's support. To try as hard as possible all ways to admonish and advise he/her parents in the hope that Allah Almighty may guide them towards repentance from haraam earnings.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You have discovered pages at a particular site, for which you have asked a proper rejoinder, that indeed show hostility towards the religion of Islam, ridicule the personality of our Prophet (peace be upon him) and carry false accusations and distortions. However, the matter is as said by Allaah (azza wa jall) (interpretation of the meaning): \"They want to blow out, with their mouths, the light that Allah has sent, but Allah has decided to bring this light to a completion even though the disbelievers do not like it\" (Al-Tawbah 9:32) I do not see any point in announcing the URL of their page in any other Islamic page which Muslims visit frequently. We should not propagate its existence or invite people to it even by indirect means. What I see as important is that some capable persons should send the proper translation of meanings of the following verse of Qur'an and other such verses to them: \"Those who disbelieve spend their wealth in distracting people from the right path, will continue to spend until it becomes a source of regret for them and then they will be overcome. And the disbelievers will be resurrected towards Hellfire so that Allaah may distinguish the evil from the righteous\" It should be enough to send them this and similar verses of Quran in rejoinder and to raise their anger. Doing so will be an act of worship and nearness to Allaah as Allaah (azza wa jall) has informed about the true believers (interpretation of the meaning): \"They suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allaah, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the righteous\"(At-Tawbah, 9:120) I ask Allaah to reward you for your religious spirit and protect and support you.",

        "question": "1. What is the position of a woman when her husband invites his brother to dinner, does she eat dinner with them, can she serve him? 2. Is the husbands brother maharam, can she travel with him?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.1. A wife is permitted to serve her husband and his guests if she is wearing complete hijaab and nothing of her body can be seen. She is also permitted to sit with them so long as there is no sitting alone with one non-mahram* man, wanton display or other cause of temptation involved. As far as eating with them is concerned, if this involves uncovering some part of her body, then she should not eat with them. 2. The husband's brother is not a mahram. The various types of mahram have been described in the Qur'aan, and this matter has already been explained under question # 316. On this basis, it is not permitted for her to travel with him. In view of the seriousness of the matter of non-mahram men, especially the husband's relatives, entering upon women, and the fact that so many people take this matter lightly, there follow a few words of important advice:Warning against non-mahram relatives entering upon women in the absence of their husbands Some homes are not free of the presence of relatives of the husband who are not mahrams of his wife. They may be living with him for a number of reasons, such as brothers who are students or bachelors. These men enter the house without there being any sense of something strange, because they are known to the neighbours as relatives of the head of the household. The neighbours know that this is a brother, or nephew or uncle. This casual approach leads to many immoral deeds that earn the wrath of Allaah because the limits that He has prescribed are not being adhered to. The basic principle in this matter should be the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"Beware of entering upon women.\" A man of the Ansaar asked, \"O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about the brother-in-law?\" He said, \"The brother-in-law is death.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330) Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: This hadeeth refers to all the relatives of the husband apart from his father and sons, who are mahrams for the wife and she is allowed to be alone with them; they are not described as \"death.\" It refers to the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and other relatives of the husband whom she would be permitted to marry if she were not already married. Because people customarily treat this matter so lightly, and a man may sit alone with his brother's wife, the brother-in-law is likened to death, and he is the foremost among non-mahram men who should be prevented from doing so. The expression \"the brother-in-law is death\" may have a number of meanings, such as the following: That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to religious doom if it results in sin. That it may lead to actual death if an immoral deed is committed that dictates the punishment of stoning. That it may spell disaster for the woman if her husband's jealousy leads to divorce. That you should fear being alone with a non-mahram woman as much as you fear death. That being alone with a non-mahram woman is as terrible as death. All of this stems from the fact that Islam wants to preserve families and households, and prevent anything that could lead to their destruction. What do you say now, after hearing the warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about those husbands who say to their wives: \"If my brother comes and I am not here, show him into the sitting-room\" or a woman who says to a male visitor: \"Go into the sitting room\" - when there is no-one else present in the house? To those who take the idea of trustworthiness as an excuse, and say things like, \"I trust my wife and I trust my brother or my cousin,\" we say: do not trust too much and do not doubt too much, but know that the hadeeth \"No man sits alone with a (non-mahram) woman, but the Shaytaan is the third among them\" (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1171) includes both the most righteous of people as well as the most immoral of people, and that Islam makes no exceptions whatsoever in such reports.A real problem This is the problem: a man marries a woman and brings her to his family's home, where she lives happily with him, then his younger brother starts to enter upon her when her husband is absent, and they begin to talk in an affectionate or even passionate manner. This leads to two things: she begins to detest her husband, and grows attached to his brother, but she cannot divorce her husband, or do what she wants to with the other. This is the grievous torment. This story represents one aspect of corruption, besides which are other kinds which reach the level of immoral sexual conduct and illegitimate children. In answer to the second question, a woman is not permitted to travel with her husband's brother, who is not her mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"A woman should not travel unless she is with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless she has a mahram with her.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1729). Among the conditions of a mahram for travel purposes are: he should be someone whom she is permanently forbidden to marry, such as her grandfather, father, brother, paternal uncle, nephew, etc. And Allaah knows best. * Translator's note: \"mahram\" refers to a blood-relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a woman's father, brother, son, uncle, etc.",
        "summary": "A wife is allowed to serve and accompany her husband and guests. However, she is not allowed to travel with them. In addition, there are exceptions for traveling with the husband's brother or uncle. A woman cannot travel with a husband unless she is wearing hijaab. There are also provisions for avoiding eye contact with strangers entering the house.",

        "question": "There are many religions. Why do Muslims think that Islam is true. Is there any factual basis?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered Islam, but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following: (1) The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. Thus the Muslim\u2019s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. Allah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people\u2019s hearts. The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it. (2) The effects of Islaamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following: Prayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a \"powerful support,\" which is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islaam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: \"Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer.\" If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist? Now let us look at zakaat (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islaam. Zakaat purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it. Fasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure. Hajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allah, which was built by Ibraaheem (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world. (3) Islaam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil. It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others. It enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islaam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards one\u2019s fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salaam) and to seek permission before entering another person\u2019s house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see. Some non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allah or salvation of the Day of Judgement. If we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man. The following examples demonstrate this: Islam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allah and the worship of anything other than Allah, because this spells doom and misery. Islaam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and people\u2019s lives; cursing time, because Allah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism. Islam forbids cancelling out good deeds by showing off, boasting or reminding others of one\u2019s favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allah on one another or damning one another to Hell. Islaam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning one\u2019s back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salaam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting one\u2019s hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up. Islaam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytaan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer. Islam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of one\u2019s wudoo\u2019 - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour. Islaam forbids buying, selling and making \"lost and found\" announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allah, where worldly affairs have no place. Islam forbids haste in walking when the iqaamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner. It is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque; to decorate a mosque with red or yellow paint or adornments which will distract the worshippers; to fast day after day without a break. Islaam forbids building over graves, making them high, sitting on them, walking between them wearing shoes, putting lights over them or writing on them. It is forbidden to disinter the dead or to take graves as places of worship. Islam forbids wailing, tearing one\u2019s clothes or leaving one\u2019s hair unkempt when a person dies. Eulogizing the dead in the manner of the times of Ignorance (Jaahiliyyah) is also forbidden, although there is nothing wrong with informing others that a person has died. Islaam forbids the consumption of riba (interest); all kinds of selling which involve ignorance (of the product), misleading and cheating; selling blood, wine, pork, idols and everything that Allah has forbidden - their price, whether bought or sold - is haraam (unlawful); najash, which is offering a price for something one has no intention of buying, as happens in many auctions; concealing a product\u2019s faults at the time of selling; selling something which one does not own or before it comes into one\u2019s possession; undercutting, outbidding or out bargaining another; selling produce before it is clear that it is in good condition and free of blemish; cheating in weights and measures; and hoarding. A partner who has shares in a plot of land or a date palm tree is forbidden to sell his share without consulting his partners. It is forbidden to consume the wealth of orphans unjustly; to bet or gamble; to take anything by force; to accept or offer bribes; to steal people\u2019s wealth or to consume it unjustly; to take something for the purpose of destroying it; to undermine the value of people\u2019s possessions; to keep lost property which one has found, or to keep quiet about it and not announce it, for it belongs to the one who recognizes it; to cheat in any way; to ask for a loan with no intention of repaying it; to take anything of the wealth of a fellow-Muslim, unless it is given freely, because what is taken because of another person\u2019s shyness is haraam (impermissible); and to accept a gift because of intercession. Celibacy and castration are forbidden, as is marrying two sisters, or a woman and her aunt (paternal or maternal), whether he marries the aunt after marrying her niece or vice versa, for fear of breaking the ties of kinship. It is forbidden to make deals in marriage, such as saying \"Let me marry your daughter and I will give you my daughter or sister in marriage.\" Such reciprocal deals are a form of oppression and injustice, and haraam. Islaam forbids mut\u2019ah (temporary marriage), which is a marriage contract for a period of time agreed by the two parties, at the end of which the marriage expires. Islaam forbids intercourse with a menstruating woman, until she has purified herself (by taking a bath after her period ends), and also forbids anal intercourse. A man is forbidden to propose marriage to a woman when another man has already proposed to her, unless the other man withdraws his proposal or gives him permission. It is forbidden to marry a previously-married woman without consulting her, or a virgin without seeking her permission. It is forbidden to wish (a newly married couple) \"Bi\u2019l-rafaa\u2019 wa\u2019l-baneen (a joyful life and many sons),\" because this is the greeting of the people of Jaahiliyyah(ignorance), who hated daughters. The divorced woman is forbidden to conceal what Allah has created in her womb (if she is pregnant). A husband and wife are forbidden to speak (to others) about the intimacies of married life. It is forbidden to turn a woman against her husband or to take divorce lightly. It is forbidden for a woman to ask for another\u2019s divorce, such as asking a man to divorce a woman so that she can marry him. A wife is forbidden to spend her husband\u2019s money without his permission, or to keep away from his bed without good reason, because the angels will curse her if she does that. A man is forbidden to marry his father\u2019s wife, or to have intercourse with a woman who is pregnant from another man. It is forbidden for a man to practice \u2018azl (coitus interruptus) with his free wife without her permission. It is forbidden for a man to return home from a journey late at night and startle his family, unless he has previously notified them when he will arrive home. A man is forbidden to take anything of his wife\u2019s mahr (dowry) without her consent, or to keep annoying his wife so that she will give up her wealth. Islaam forbids women to make a wanton display of themselves (tabarruj). It also forbids extreme forms of female circumcision. Women are forbidden to admit anyone into their husband\u2019s home without his permission; his general permission is acceptable so long as they stay within the limits of sharee\u2019ah (Islaamic law). It is forbidden to separate a mother and child (in case of divorce); to let one\u2019s womenfolk behave foolishly (in an immoral fashion) and not say anything; to let one\u2019s gaze wander everywhere; and to follow an accidental glance with an intentional glance. Islaam forbids the eating of dead meat, regardless of whether it died by drowning, strangulation, shock or falling from a high place; eating blood, pork and anything slaughtered in a name other than that of Allah or for idols; eating the flesh or drinking the milk of beasts that feed on filth and waste matter; eating the flesh of every carnivorous beast that has fangs and every bird that has talons; eating the meat of domesticated donkeys; killing animals by keeping them and throwing stones at them until they die, or detaining them without food until they die; slaughtering with teeth or nails; slaughtering one animal (for food) in front of another; or sharpening the knife in front of the animal to be slaughtered. In the area of clothing and adornment, men are forbidden the extravagance of wearing gold. Muslim men are forbidden to be naked or to expose their thighs; to leave their clothes long (below the ankles) and trail them on the ground for the purpose of showing off; and to wear clothes that will attract attention. It is forbidden to bear false witness; to make false accusations against a chaste believing woman; to accuse someone who is innocent; to utter lies; to slander and backbite; to call people by offensive nicknames; to spread gossip and malicious slander; to make fun of the Muslims; to boast about one\u2019s status; to shed doubts on a person\u2019s lineage; to utter slander, insults and obscenities; to speak in an indecent or rude manner; or to utter evil in public, except by one who has been wronged. Islaam forbids telling lies; one of the worst kinds of lie is to lie about dreams, like fabricating dreams and visions in order to prove one\u2019s virtue, or make some material gains, or to frighten an enemy. Muslims are forbidden to praise themselves, or to talk in a secret way: two may not converse secretly to the exclusion of a third, because this is offensive. It is forbidden to curse a believer or someone who does not deserve to be cursed. Islaam forbids speaking ill of the dead; praying for death; wishing for death because of some suffering that one is passing through; praying against one\u2019s self, one\u2019s children, one\u2019s servants or one\u2019s wealth. Muslims are told not to eat the food that is directly in front of others or to eat from the centre of the dish or platter; rather they should eat from what is directly in front of them or thereabouts, because the barakah (blessing) comes in the middle of the food. It is forbidden to drink from a broken edge of a vessel, because this could cause harm; or to drink from the mouth of a vessel; or to breathe into it. It is forbidden to eat while lying on one\u2019s stomach; to sit at a table where wine is being drunk; to leave a fire burning in one\u2019s house when one sleeps; to sleep with Ghamr in one\u2019s hand, like an offensive smell or the remainder of food (grease); to sleep on one\u2019s stomach; or to talk about or try to interpret bad dreams, because these are tricks of the Shaytaan. It is forbidden to kill another person except in cases where it is right to do so; to kill one\u2019s children for fear of poverty; to commit suicide; to commit fornication, adultery or sodomy (homosexuality); to drink wine, or even to prepare it, carry it from one place to another, or sell it. Muslims are forbidden to please people by angering Allah; to offend their parents or even to say \"Uff\" (the slightest word of contempt) to them; to claim that a child belongs to anyone but his real father; to torture by means of fire; to burn anyone, alive or dead, with fire; to mutilate the bodies of the slain; to help anyone commit falsehood; or to cooperate in wrongdoing and sin. It is forbidden to obey any person by disobeying Allah; to swear falsely; to swear a disastrous oath; to eavesdrop on people without their permission; to invade people\u2019s privacy or look at their private parts; to claim something that does not belong to one or that one did not do, for the purpose of showing off; to look into someone\u2019s else\u2019s house without permission; to be extravagant; to swear an oath to do something wrong; to spy on others or be suspicious about righteous men and women; to envy, hate or shun one another; to persist in falsehood; to be arrogant or feel superior; to be filled with self-admiration; to be pleased with one\u2019s arrogance. Islam forbids taking back one\u2019s charity, even if one pays to get it back; employing someone to do a job without paying him his wages; being unfair in giving gifts to one\u2019s children; bequeathing everything in one\u2019s will and leaving one\u2019s heirs poor - in such a case the will should not be executed; writing a will that concerns more than one third of one\u2019s legacy; being a bad neighbour; or changing a will to the detriment of one or some of one\u2019s heirs. A Muslim is forbidden to forsake or shun his brother for more than three days, except for a reason sanctioned by sharee\u2019ah; to hold small stones between two fingers and throw them because this could cause injury to eyes or teeth; to include his heirs in a will, because Allah has already given heirs their rights of inheritance; to disturb his neighbour; to point a weapon at his Muslim brother; to hand someone an unsheathed sword, lest it harm him; to come (walk) between two people except with their permission; to return a gift, unless there is some shar\u2019i objection to it; to be extravagant; to give money to foolish people; to wish to be like someone to whom Allah has given more of something; to cancel out his charity by giving offensive reminders of his giving; to wilfully conceal testimony; or to oppress orphans or scold one who asks for help or money. It is forbidden to treat with evil medicines, because Allah would not create a cure for this ummah which includes something that He has forbidden. It is forbidden to kill women and children in warfare; to boast to one another; or to break promises. Islaam forbids betraying a trust; asking for charity that one does not need; alarming a Muslim brother or taking away his possessions, whether jokingly or seriously; changing one\u2019s mind after giving a gift, except in the case of a gift from a father to his child; practising medicine without experience; or killing ants, bees and hoopoe birds. A man is forbidden to look at the \u2018awrah (private parts) of another man, and a woman is forbidden to look at the \u2018awrah of another woman. It is forbidden to sit between two people without their permission; or to greet only those whom one knows, because the greeting is to be given to those whom you know and those whom you do not know. A Muslim is forbidden to let an oath come between him and good deeds; he should do what is good and make expiation for the oath. It is forbidden to judge between two disputing parties when one is angry, or to judge in favour of one party without hearing what the other has to say. It is forbidden for a man to walk through the market-place carrying something - like a sharp weapon - that could harm the Muslims, unless it is properly covered. A Muslim is forbidden to make another person get up, so that he can take his place. There are more commands and prohibitions which came for the benefit and happiness of individuals and mankind as a whole. Have you ever seen any other religion that can compare to this religion? Read this response again, then ask yourself: is it not a great pity that I am not one of them? Allah says in the Qur\u2019aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:85] Finally, I hope that everyone who reads this will be guided to the correct way and to follow the truth. May Allah protect you and us from all evil.",
        "summary": "The Prophet explains that the Muslim worships one God, who has no partner. He is omniscient and sees all intentions; he is the seer of the unseen, so he understands all intentions and hidden in people's hearts. The Prophet uses examples from this book to explain how the effects of prayer on the soul can be discernible. Prayer keeps a slave in touch with his Lord and Creator. It also keeps him from committing sin by showing off or reminding anyone else of his good intentions. In addition, prayer keeps the slave engaged in conversation with his lord and creator. For example, if you're wondering what religion does for a living, it doesn\u2019t do anything for you. It just makes you feel better.\nAnother objection to it is that it is a pity that he is not one of the religious leaders who espouse this religion. In addition, there are other commands and prohibitions against it as well. For example, in order to be a good Muslim, one has to obey the rules of al-Qur'an, which state that no one can convert to Islam except those who wish to do so. Lastly, we hope that everyone will be guided by the correct method and follow the truth; otherwise, they will be among the losers.",

        "question": "How soon do a married couple have to consumate their marriage in Islam? If one of the partners feels uncomfortable, what is he/she to do, if he/she does not want to consumate right away, but would prefer to wait about 3 months?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. If a man executes a valid marriage contract with a woman then it is permissible for the two to do as they please between themselves, even with only the contract. There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah between the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up to the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their best interests. It is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the other one's personal comfort and ease. Thus, if the husband sees that the wife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship and level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example, he should do so, and vice versa. Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife if she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by consummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he does not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice versa.",
        "summary": "If a man and a woman sign a marriage contract, then it is up to both parties to decide what they want to do with the contract. It is also up to the wife whether or not she feels that her husband needs to guard chastity by signing the contract, or if she senses that his chastity is too high, as she does not want him to be chastened by the marriage, then she shouldn't prolong the period of time so that he doesn't fall into discomfort and difficulty.",

        "question": "Assalam'alaicum wa rahmatoullahi wa barakatouh I heard a muslim brother and a imam saying that: a) People who have children and embrace islam should make a 'aqiqa for them (the children), no matter how old they are and also one for themselves because their non-muslim parents did not make one for them; b) Making a 'aqiqa is so important that if one doesn't have the money to make it, he should borrow that money. However, they didn't give any references to prove what they said. What is the truth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.wa aliaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh. al-hamdu lillaah. (a) Jumhoor al-ulemaa' (vast majority of the scholars) agree that the aqeeqa is a sunnah mustahabbah for those who are capable of doing it and can afford it. Among its benefits are breaking the influence of the shaitaan on the new-born. It is also permissible for a Muslim to make an aqeeqah for himself if his parents did not perform it for him. Similarly, he can do it for his children even if it is after many years if he didn't do it when they were young. Refer to the book \"Tuhfat ul-Mawdood bi-Ahkaam il-Mawlood\" by Imam Ibn ul-Qayyim, Chapter 6: \"The Aqeeqah and its Rulings\", Part 19: \"The Ruling for One Whose Parents Did Not Perform an Aqeeqah--Should He Perform one on His Own Behalf?\" for more details. It is mentioned there that Ismaa'il ibn Sa'eed al-Shaalanji asked (Imam) Ahmed regarding a man whose father informed him that he did not perform an aqeeqah on his behalf--should he perform it on his own behalf? He said, \"That is the father's duty.\"... and it was said, \"Should one perform an aqeeqah on his own behalf as an adult?\"... and I saw that it is preferrable if an aqeeqah was not performed as a child then it should be performed as an adult, and (Imam Ahmed) said: \"If someone does that I would not discourage it or regard it as reprehensible.\" (b) It is not mandatory for a person to take a loan in order to spend on an aqeeqah. However, if he does it then it would be considered commendable as per Imam Ahmed's opinion. It was related by Abi il-Harith that he asked Abu Abdullah regarding one who doesn't have enough to perform an aqeeqah; Imam Ahmed said, \"If he borrowed for it I hope Allaah would reward and provide for him by virtue that he has observed a sunnah.\" Refer to \"Tuhfat il-Mawdood,\" same chapter, Part 11: \"Regarding Borrowing for an Aqeeqah and its Rulings and Benefits.\"",
        "summary": "This chapter is full of praise and praise from the al-ulemmaa. It is a supreme majority of scholars who agree with the aiqeeqa, i.e., that it is a must for those who can afford it or who are able to afford it. Although some scholars may disagree with this interpretation, others do support it. For example, Isma'il ibn Abd al-Rahmanji asked the imam about whether he should take a loan to spend on performing an aqueeeqah as an adult. The imam responded that if someone takes a loan, he hopes Allaah would reward him by virtue of his sunnah.",

He has been sitting outside for 2 months now. He has even spit on our mother. At first we thought there was something psychologically wrong with him. However, when we took him to a mental doctor, he talked as if he was fine. We think he is either possessed by a Jinn or some magic was done to him. How can you tell if someone is possessed or if magic was done to them? How do you remove it? My mother is getting very sick over this.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Signs of jinn or Satanic possession People who have had experience with such situations have related that the following are among the signs of a person who is possessed by jinn (or Satan): Strong repulsion when hearing the Quran or Athan (call for prayers). Episodes of losing consciousness and/or epileptic attacks, especially when Quran is recited for the possessed person. Frequent nightmares during sleep. Tendency to avoid people accompanied by out-of-the-norm behavior. The jinni who possess him might speak when the Quran is recited for the possessed person. Madness, as stated in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom Satan by his touch hath driven to [epileptic] madness\" (2:275) Signs of black magic As for a person struck by magic he might experience the following: Dislike of ones\u2019 spouse, as indicated in the Quran by the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): \"And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife...\" (Al-Baqarah, 2:102) Different attitude in the house from that which is outside the house. For example, a person will feel that he is missing his family when is outside the house but when he goes home, love changes quickly to extreme hatred. Inability to have sexual intercourse with ones spouse. Frequent miscarriage for pregnant women. Sudden change in behavior without obvious reason. Complete loss of appetite for food. Thinking or imagining one has done something when in reality one has not. Sudden obedience and/or love for a particular person. It should be noted that if a person experiences some of the above symptoms this does not necessarily mean that he is either possessed by a jinni or struck by black magic. It might be due to physiological or psychological reasons. How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession As for curing this condition the following steps are recommended: Putting ones trust in Allah with a sincere belief that He is the only cure for everything. Reading Quran and known supplications expressing seeking refuge, the most important and effective of which is sura 113 and 114, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas, which were used to cure the Prophet himself. Surah 112, Al-Ikhlas, is recommended along with them, as well as the opening chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatihah. To cure black magic, some have successfully used seven lote-tree leaves. The leaves should be crushed, then mixed with water (enough for taking a bath). The following verses from the Quran are then recited: verse Al-Kursi (2:255), surah Al-Kafirun (109), surah 112, 113, 114; the verses which mention magic, which are: in surah Al-Baqarah (2:102), Al-A\u2019raf (7:117-119), Yunus (10:79-82), and Taha (20:65-69). The possessed person drinks some of the water, and the rest is used to give him a bath. Removing the elements of magic as was done by the Prophet when he was struck by black magic by a Jewish man called Lubaid ibn Al-\u2019Asim. Eating seven Aliya Al-Barniy dates (among the dates of Al-Madinah) first thing in the morning; if not possible, any dates will suffice, by the will of Allah. Cupping --removing excess blood. Offering supplications. And we ask Allah to cure your brother and ease your hardship and his, as He is the One who cures and there is no one else who can cure. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "The signs of a possessed person are among the symptoms of a person possessed by Satan.

Insomnia, frequent nightmares, and sudden change in behavior. Madness, as demonstrated in the Quran, ad nauseum. Seizures of black magic. Signs of Satanic possession Black magic is associated with \"black magic\" and \" Satanic possession.\" It can also lead to marital infidelity, pregnancy, and premature death. In addition, black magic can cause separation between man and wife. There are other symptoms that could indicate black magic, such as periods of losing consciousness, epileptic seizures, and delirium. If these symptoms are present, then it might be time to take action against black magic or Satanic possession.

My question is, is the money we are making and paying off our Debts is Hilal or Haram, plus the profits. Second thing, i am working their too and i take salary, is that Halal? Thank u,,,,",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Borrowing with interest is considered one of the greatest of the major sins (al-kabaa'ir). The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) has cursed those who consume interest, and those who pay it. Borrowing money with interest is considered as peddling in it as the borrower pays it to the borrower. Whoever does this is to repent and express remorse, and he is to try as much as he can to return only the principle he borrowed without the interest, advising the person who lent him the money against this practice. If he cannot, as in the case of borrowing from interest-based banks, which rarely forgive but rather get back their dues even if by force, he is to return the principle plus the interest offering repentance to Allaah at the same time. Whatever the borrower has bought or developed in terms of legitimate and Islamically-permitted business based on the borrowed money, can remain in his possession. He is allowed to continue his enterprise and profit from it, paying sadaqah at the time on a frequent basis to purify his business and himself of the misdeed he has committed. Those who work in businesses functioning on money borrowed using interest for which they are not responsible can continue to work in such enterprises as long as the nature of the business is halaal and legitimate such as a Laundromat, etc. Allaah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is most correct and best.",
        "summary": "we'll discuss borrowing money with interest and how it's different from what we're used to now. Anyone who borrows money using interest can continue to operate as long as they don't overcharge or overburden themselves by paying interest on the money borrowed.

        "question": "Assalamalaykum wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh, My family is not very religious but I try to be, but am constantly mocked and ridiculed for trying to follow the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad and enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong. My family think I am extreme in my views because I hold hadith in high regard, whereas my father does not. He believes that a hadith explaining the commandments in the Qur'an, for example praying, should be followed, but those concerning matters outside of the Quern, for example prohibition of touching a female who is not your mehram, should not be followed. He has many other beliefs, but my question is this: Is it permissible for me to pray behind him with him as the Imam? If not, is it permissible for me to pretend that I am praying so that he does not feel offended that I do not want to pray behind him? Because I have read in Quern that children should not hurt their parents, and one of the biggest sins in Islam is a child making his parents cry, and I feel that in telling him that I am not able to pray behind him, I would infact hurt him. I eagerly await your response. Jazzakallahkhairum for your help. Wa alaykum-as-salam wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. The situation in which you are, dear brother, is certainly a difficult one. It is not easy to live with a father that has aberrations and perversities stemming from being misguided from the true path of ahl us-sunnah wal-jamaaah (the followers of the Quraan, sunnah, and our pious predecessors). However, a Muslim is to anticipate and seek reward from Allaah for: being patient with and persevering in dealing with your father; and, being polite when counseling and showing him the truth of guidance, using appropriate and agreeable methods that do not give your father the impression that you are trying to show superiority or arrogance, or that you are belittling him. Instead, your father should feel that the advice is from a son that acknowledges and respects his position as his father, and that your concern is out of care and veneration., as the case was with Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when calling his father to the path of truth. Allaah the Most Glorious said in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): When he (Ibrahim) said to his father: \"O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything? O my father! Verily, there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. O my father! Worship not Satan. Verily, Satan has been a rebel against the Most Beneficent (Allah). O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allaah) overtake you, so that you become a companion of Satan ( in Hell-Fire).\" He (the father) said: \" Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop (this), I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely before I punish you.\" Ibrahim said :\" Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me, ever most gracious. (surat Maryam, 19:41-47) Note that Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) addressed his father in the most subordinate and most refined, courteous, and polite expression (abati in Arabic). Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not say to him, \"I am a scholar and you are ignorant\"; instead, he said \"There has come to me of knowledge (as a Prophet) that which has not come unto you.\" Ibrahim (peace be upon him) showed his concern and compassion towards his fathers well-being when he said, \"O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allaah) overtake you.\" When his father rejected the truth and threatened to stone him, Ibrahim (peace be upon him) replied in utmost politeness, \"Peace be upon you,\" and promised him that he will pray to his Lord on his behalf for forgiveness. This is how a righteous son should advise his misguided father. You also should know that rejecting or denying the sunnah of our Prophet (peace be upon him) is an extremely grave matter; hopefully this subject will be covered in detail as a separate issue. In brief, if your fathers bidaah (innovation in religion) takes him out of the fold of Islam, then your prayers behind him is not valid since he would be a kafir (infidel, unbeliever). Such would be the case if, for example, he insists and persists in completely rejecting the sunnah in its entirety, even after the proof and evidence demonstrating and substantiating the truth and validity of the matter is presented to him. On the other hand, if your fathers bidaah does not take him out of the fold of Islam, such as the case of refusing to perform certain acts mentioned in the Quraan and Sunnah, then it is permissible to pray behind him and your prayers are sound, and Allaah knows best. Addendum: Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn Uthaimeen has replied the following with regards to this question: Denying (the sunnah) could be of two types: a denial with regards to interpretation or a denial of rejection. If it is a denial of rejection, in the sense that one might say, \"Yes, I realize that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this, but I reject it and dont accept it,\" then the person is a kaafir (unbeliever) and has committed apostasy. Thus, it would be impermissible to pray behind him. If, on the other hand, it is a denial of interpretation, then he is granted a respite, if the interpretation is possible and warranted by the language, and he knows the sources of Islamic law and its resources. In this case, it is not an act of kufr, but rather under the category of those who innovate incorrect practices in the religion (if his interpretation is such). It would be permissible to pray behind such a person, unless there is a beneficial objective behind not doing so, such as deterring him from such opinions, so that he may reconsider his mistaken interpretations. In this latter case, then it would be preferable not to pray behind him (if such a beneficial effect would be realized).",
        "summary": "The narrator emphasizes that the importance of patience in dealing with a father-in-law, especially when it comes to understanding and following the teachings of the sunnah. A Muslim should be patient with his father; he should not give off the impression that he is trying to gain superiority over his father, or that he belittles him. The narrator also emphasizes that there are some important distinctions between \"adherence\" and \"denial.\" For example, if your father rejects the Sunnah because it is clear that the Prophet has come to him, then you may not be able to follow his advice. Similarly, if his father continues to reject the sunnies, then this will be considered as an infidel- unbeliever case.",

        "question": "Why do some people accept and somenot accept the celebration of Prophet Muhamamd\u2019s birthday (malwid al-nabi)? What is your opinion?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad\u2019s birthday)? There is nothing in the Quran to say that we should celebrate the Mawlid al-Nabi or the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet himself did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. Indeed, he told his Companions not to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be peace). He said: \u201cDo not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, \u2018The slave of Allah and His Messenger.\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari) What did Prophet Muhammad do on the day of his birth? What has been reported is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made the day of his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said: \u201cThat is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation.\u201d (Reported by Muslim, al-Nasai and Abu Dawood) Did the Companions celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Moreover, we know that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the people who loved the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) most. Was it reported that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), who was the closest of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Was it reported that \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who ruled for twelve years, or \u2018Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), did this? Was it reported that \u2018Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), his relative and foster son, did this? Was it reported that any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did this? No, by Allah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? No one would say such a thing except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray. Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Did any of the imams \u2013 Abu Haneefah, Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen (may Allah have mercy on them) \u2013 do this or command others to do it or say that it was good? By Allah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three centuries. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: \u201cThe best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take such a matter seriously).\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear? The celebration of the Prophet\u2019s birthday appeared many centuries later, when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bid\u2019ah had become widespread. Thus this celebration became a sign of one\u2019s love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? But can it be possible that the Sahabah, the imams and the people of the best three centuries were unaware of it, and it was only those who came later who were aware of its importance?! How to express love for Prophet Muhammad What the Quran tells us is that love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is demonstrated by following the guidance he brought. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSay (O Muhammad): \u2018If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: \u2018Obey Allah and the Messenger.\u2019 But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.\u201d [Aal \u2018Imran 3:31-32] The first ayah explains that love is just a claim, but the proof of sincerity is following what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. The second ayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allah and His Messenger. Hence Allah ended the ayah with a very stern warning in which those who refuse to obey are described as kafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask Allah to keep us safe from that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought \u2013 as all the scholars agree. He said: \u201cThe best of speech is the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.\u201d (Reported by Muslim and al-Nasai). We ask Allah to protect us from bid\u2019ah and to bless us by helping us to follow. Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad. And Allah knows best.",

It is not because dead people can see their visitors. This reason is invalid and the rules of the world of the dead people are different from the rules dealing with the world of living people. If the reason for prohibition was the ability of the deceased to see people who are alive naked, then it would also be prohibited for men to visit the graves. You need to encourage your mother and sister to make du'aa (supplication) for your father, as this offers the greatest benefit to the deceased, and it is much better than the mere visit.

I know a lot of Muslims think that it is good to do so because it will protect them and their house. Personally, I consider it a form of shirk or superstition. Is there any ruling on that subject?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes, schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following: In most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind. Some people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images. This is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated. Hanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du\u2019as taught in the Quran and Sunnah. There is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money. Many of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram. Many of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings. Verses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned. Some Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way. All in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads? What really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter. The Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad. For more, please see these answers: 39185, 13648 and 170060. And Allah knows best.",

Isnt marrying between brothers and sisters haram in the Quran? Can you recommend a good book(s) on Islamic Law covering every and each aspect of Life? Thank you very much for the generous work for the sake of Allah. Thanks.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh All Praise be to Allaah. As long as you are confident in your heart about your belief, no such insinuations will hurt you (inshaa' Allaah). If a doubt strikes a believer or something appears to him as a conflict between different textual sources of Shari'ah, he must believe that indeed for such doubts there are true answers and for such apparent conflicts there are solutions even if he doesnt know it or is unable to find the right answer himself. However, a person should not collect all the doubts in his heart and worry about the complexities and leave aside the learning of useful knowledge. This is because it is incumbent upon a Muslim to learn and know things which have been clearly described (Muhkamaat) in Shari'ah so that he may be able to repel the doubts. Regarding the question you have asked, it is a known fact that legislation differs from one Shari'ah to another, while the principles and beliefs remain the same in all of them. So, making of portraits was allowed in the Shari'ah of Sulayman (peace be upon him) but is prohibited in our Shari'ah. Similarly, making prostration of salutation was permitted in the Shari'ah of Yusuf (peace be upon him) but is illegal in ours. Also, war booty was prohibited for nations before us but it is completely legal for us. The Qiblah of people before us used to be towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, but for us it is towards Ka'bah. In a similar way, marriage between brothers and sisters was permitted in the Shari'ah of Adam (peace be upon him) as opposed to those that came afterwards. The following is a clarification on the issue by Haafidh Ibn Katheer, who said: Allaah allowed Adam (peace be upon him) to marry his daughters to his sons for necessity. Every couple used to have a boy and a girl. Hence, he married the girl of one couple to the boy of another. This is said by Suddi regarding what has been narrated by Abu Maalik and Abu Salih, from Ibn Abbas, by Murrah from Ibn Masood and by other companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that Adam did not have (in his grandchildren) a baby boy unless it was accompanied by a girl, so he married the male of a couple to the female of another, and the female of a couple to the male of another.",

        "question": "If you have to do sujud-as-sahw, but you forget and do not do it, is the prayer valid? Is there a way to make up for it after the prayer has finished or must the whole prayer be repeated? What if you remember when you are praying sunnah - should you break your prayer?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Imam al-Mirdawi said in al-Insaf (2/154): The author\u2013 Ibn Qudamah \u2013 said that two conditions apply for sujud to be made up later: It should be in the mosque A long time should not have passed. This is the right opinion, as he stated. Imam Ahmad said: \u201cHe should do the sujud if the time that has passed is short, even if he has left the mosque.\u201d He also said: \u201cHe should do the sujud even if the time that has passed is long, or he has spoken or left the mosque. This is the opinion favoured by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah].\u201d (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94) In Al-Rawd al-Murbi\u2019 Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni\u2019 (2/461) it says: \u201c(If he forgets), i.e., he forgets to do the sujud as-sahw which should be done before the salam, (and he says salam), then he remembers, (he should do the sujud) and it is obligatory (if the time that has passed is short)... If he has said salam \u2013 and if a long time has passed according to what is ordinarily regarded as a long time, or he broke his wudu, or he left the mosque \u2013 he does not need to do the sujud, and his prayer is still valid.\u201d In Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-\u2018Uthaymin (3/537), it says: \u201cThe phrase \u2018If he forgets and says salam, he should still do the sujud if the time that has passed is short\u2019 refers to the sujud that should be done before the salam, when he has already said the salam. He should do this sujud if the time that has passed is short, otherwise he no longer has to do it, and his prayer is still valid. Examples: A man may forget the first tashahhud, so he has to do sujud as-sahw before the salam, but he forgets and says the salam. If he remembers shortly afterwards, he should do the sujud, but if he remembers a long time afterwards, he no longer has to do it. This is why he said \u2018He should do sujud if only a short time has passed. If he has left the mosque, he should not come back to do this sujud \u2013 he no longer has to do it, which is unlike when he has said salam before completing the prayer. In the latter case, he should come back and complete it, because he has omitted an obligatory act. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: Indeed, he should do the sujud, even if a long time has passed, because this will make up for what was missing. So when he remembers it, he should make up for it. But the most likely opinion is that suggested by the author (may Allah have mercy on him), which is that if a long time has passed, the person no longer has to do the sujud, because sujud as-sahw is obligatory (wajib) either to make the prayer valid or it is wajib in the prayer as part of the prayer, so it is connected to the prayer and is not a separate prayer. We say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever sleeps and misses the prayer, as soon as he remembers, let him pray.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari (597) and Muslim (684) from the hadith of Anas) But we cannot use this evidence with regard to sujud as-sahw, because it is part of something else. If a person remembers soon afterwards, he should do it, otherwise he does not have to do it.\u201d And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "This is a very short list of things that we don't know about al-Qaeda. We just checked in with some of our favorite quotes from al-Ahmad, including: 1) The author says that two conditions are required for sujud : 1) He should do it later or 2) he should not have to say salam at all if the time has passed by; and 3) If he forgets something, then he should be able to remember it and/or re-do it. And finally, if he remembers everything, then his prayer is valid.",

This has been narrated by \u2018Abdur Razzaq in Al-Musannaf 3/141 and Daraqutni 1/404, and is authentic due to evidences for it. Similarly Umm Al-Hasan narrated that she saw Umm Salmah (may Allaah be pleased with her) leading women in prayer while she stood in the middle of their row.

We do not know of a difference of opinion on this among those who support that one women may lead others in congregation. Since it is recommended for the women to be covered,..... standing in the middle of the row makes it a better covering for her from the sides.\u201d(Al-Mughni, 2/202) The author of Al-Muhadhdhab (4/295) says: \u201cIt is sunnah that the leader of women in congregation stand in the middle of them as narrated about \u2018Aa\u2019ishah and Umm Salmah that they lead women and stood in the middle of their row.\u201d For further details refer to Jaami\u2018 Ahkaam Al-Nisaa\u2019 by Al-\u2018Adawi (1/351).

        "question": "I have been told that a woman cannot put nailpolish because the wadoo is not done with it. How far is this true. Can she wear nailpolish (or any sort of makeup and perfo9rm her wadoo and salat.)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. Some powders and cosmetics that are used as makeup form a insulating layer over the skin and prevent water from reaching it, while others do not prevent water from reaching the skin. If a cosmetic item insulates the skin (e.g., nailpolish as asked in the question) then it is not permissible to perform wudoo' or ghusl over it, for any act of worship that requires wudoo or ghusl (such as prayer, etc.). Allaah the most glorified and Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): \"O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and hands.\" Al-Maa'idah (5:6) Washing implies that water must actually reach the part of the body being washed. Based on this observation, anything that prevents water from reaching the skin must be removed, otherwise purification will not be achieved, resulting in the prayer being void. If the cosmetic item does not insulate the skin and does not prevent water from reaching it (e.g., dying by henna or similar things which do not insulate the skin), then wudoo' or ghusl may be performed with it. Hence, dyes are of two type: the first is that which is waterproof, such as nailpolish, which must be removed before performing wudoo' or ghusl. The second is that which does not form an impermeable barrier to water, such as henna dye, and hence does not hurt the wudoo or ghusl. And Allah the most glorified and Almighty knows what is most correct and best. References: Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam Al-Marah, Abdul Karim Zaidan, 1/84-85.

Dyes are waterproof, so they cannot be used with it. Wudoo', or ghusls are also prohibited. However, if you're going to pray, wash your face and hands before performing a wudoo'.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. If your friend is mentally sound, then all you have mentioned about him indicates his disrespect of prayers. If he means what he says, then he would perform his prayers. His claim that he likes prayers is not truthful; if it were, then he would perform them accordingly. In fact, the following verse from the Holy Qur'aan applies to such a recalcitrant and unobservant person (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then there has succeeded them a posterity who have neglected and lost the prayers, and followed their lusts; thus, they will face devastation (on the Day of Judgment, i.e., he will face Hell).\" Surat Maryam 19:59. By completely ceasing to perform prayers, a person is judged to be a kaafir, based on several ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace be upon him), one of which is: \"The obligation and pact between us and them (the munaafiqeen, the hypocrites) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has indeed committed kufr (i.e., become a kaafir, a non-believer).\" (Tirmidhi, hadeeth #2621, and it is sahih) The meaning here is that the hypocrites are guaranteed their security and immunity from being fought by the Muslims as long as they perform their prayers; if they abandon their prayers, then they are among the kuffaar, and are subject to being fought and killed in the war against them. The Prophet further says, \"What is between a person and committing shirk (associating partners with Allaah) and kufr (disbelief) is abandoning the prayer.\" (Sahih Muslim, #82) The man in question, accordingly, is to be shunned--no one should eat the meat he slaughters; he is not to marry a Muslimah; he is not to inherit a Muslim relative; he is not allowed to enter Mecca; upon dying he is not entitled to Muslim burial rites such as the washing of the body or the shrouding or the funeral prayer; and his inheritance is to go to the the community fund and not to his inheritors. Thus, it is incumbent upon you to exert as much effort as possible in advising him and admonishing him concerning the gravity and danger of his crime, and of the punishment of Allaah the Almighty. If he persists and rejects your admonition, then you would not be wrong in abstaining from your friendship with him, until you can solicit help from other friends among those who accept guidance so that you may spend your time with them inviting him to Allaah.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What your muallim (teacher) has told you, that in sujood the toes should be bent and should touch the ground, is correct. It is a proven part of the sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prostrated the tips of his toes would be facing the qiblah (Fath, no. 828). Abu Dawood reported from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi: he would bend his toes when he prostrated. (Reported by Abu Dawood, no. 716, Bab fi iftitaah al-salaah). The author of Awn al-Mabood Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood said: He would bend (yaftukh) his toes the meaning of fatkh is to bend or flex, so he would bend his toes and point them towards the qiblah. (Awn al-Mabood, 2/419). The hadeeth was reported by al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah p. 142, 1411 AH edition [This book is also available in English under the title The Prophets Prayer Described Translator]. Pointing the toes towards the qiblah is sunnah and is encouraged, but if a person does not do it, his prayer or leadership of the prayer is still valid, especially as many people do not have the ability to flex their toes in the manner described. But everyone should put their toes on the ground when prostrating, because they are counted among the seven parts of the body on which we are commanded to prostrate. If a person lifts his feet off the ground when prostrating, and does not place the tips of his toes on the ground, then his prayer or leadership of the prayer is not valid. With regard to the way one should sit between sujoods, two ways of doing this have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Keeping the right foot upright and sitting on the left foot, as was described in the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: He kept his right foot upright, and he pointed its toes towards the qiblah. This is the most well known way, and it is the way he sat most of the time. Keeping both feet upright and sitting on the heels, as was described in the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: Sometimes he would rest on both his heels and the balls on his feet. (See Sifat al-Salaah by al-Albaani, p. 152). This is not the way of sitting that is forbidden. If a person who is praying puts one foot on top of the other and sits on them, he is doing something other than the sunnah, but his prayer or leadership of the prayer is still valid. In all cases, we should guide people towards the sunnah and teach them about it, because this is an important matter how could it be otherwise? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Pray as you have seen me praying. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 631). And Allaah knows best.",

        "question": "In a discussion among Muslims, we were trying to arrive at a definition of \"love\" in Islam. Though we are all well aware of the love of Allah SWT and our obligation to love both Him and his Prophet(s), we wondered if there is a clear outline of love between humans (similar to the Christian \"brotherly love\"...NOT the romantic variety). Some posited that \"love\" lies only within the family, all else is but respect/friend- ship/etc. Others questioned whether love is limited to spouse and/or children. Still others questioned if love can be con-ditional or not. One idea is that \"love\" (as the term is commonly used) may even be an 'innovation' of sorts, based on fairy tales and Christian philosophy. Many of us have looked in various sources to seek out an \"answer\", but no one has found a definitive answer as of yet... Can you help?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.I was very happy to hear that you and your sisters are studying Islamic issues and trying to find out about Islamic views of love. No doubt you and your sisters understand the importance of the scholars views and referring to them in matters of dispute. I will quote here a number of views about love, so that you will understand the matter better, in sha Allaah Love may be divided into mahabbah khaassah (specific love) and mahabbah mushtarakah (general love). Mahabbah khaassah (specific love): Specific love may be divided into types that are halaal and types that are haraam. Halaal love includes: (1) Love of Allaah, which is the most important obligation, as it is the basis of Islam. By perfecting ones love of Allaah, one perfects ones faith. If ones love of Allaah is lacking, then ones Tawheed is also lacking. The daleel (evidence) for this is the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):... But those who believe, love Allaah more (than anything else)... [al-Baqarah 2:165] Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight... are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are faasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient). [al-Tawbah 9:24] There are also other similar proofs in the Quraan and Sunnah. Love of Allaah may also take the form of preferring what Allaah loves and wants of His slave to what the slave himself might love and want. So he loves what Allaah loves, hates what He hates, takes as friends or regards as enemies for His sake, and adheres to His laws. There is much that may strengthen this love. (2) Love of Allaahs Messenger, which is also one of the most important duties of Islaam. Indeed, faith is not complete until a person loves the Messenger of Allaah more than he loves himself, as in the ahaadeeth: The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said: None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people. (Reported by Muslim, no. 44). Abdullaah ibn Hishaam said: We were with the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he was holding the hand of Umar ibn al-Khattaab. Umar said to him: O Messenger of Allaah, you are dearer to me than everything except my own self. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: No (that is not right), by the One in Whose hand is my soul, until I am dearer to you than your own self. Umar said to him, Now, by Allaah, you are dearer to me than my own self. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Now (you are right), O Umar. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6632). This love is part of loving Allaah and is manifested by following the Prophet (peace be upon him) and preferring his opinion over that of others. (3) Love of the Prophets and the believers. This is obligatory because loving Allaah dictates that one should love the people who obey Him, in other words the Prophets and righteous people. The daleel (evidence) for this is the hadeeth Whoever loves for the sake of Allaah (i.e., loves the people of faith for the sake of Allaah). Obedience to Allaah is based on love of Allaah. Faith cannot be perfected except in this way, even if one has a lot of prayer and fasting to ones credit. As Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: You have seen us at the time of the Messenger of Allaah: none of us would think that he had more right to his own money than his Muslim brother. Forbidden love: This includes love which constitutes shirk, which is when a person loves something instead of Allaah or as much as Him. In such a case he has taken that thing as a rival to Allaah. This is the shirk of love, and most people have taken things as rivals to Allaah in love and glorification. There are also types of forbidden love which do not go to the extent of shirk, such as loving ones family, wealth, tribe, business or house, and preferring those things, in whole or in part, over doing the duties that Allaah requires of him, such as hijrah (migration for His sake), jihaad, etc. The daleel (evidence) for this is the aayah quoted above (Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight... are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). [al-Tawbah 9:24]) Mahabbah mushtarakah (general love): General love is of three types: (1) Natural love, such as the love of a hungry person for food, or a thirsty person for water. This does not involve any kind of glorification, so it is permissible. (2) Love based on mercy and pity, such as the love of a father for his small child. This also involves no kind of glorification, so there is nothing wrong with it.

        "question": "If a Muslim performs taraaweeh in a mosque, is it allowed for him to perform the night prayer at home? What is the Prophet's (peace be upon him) manner in performing night prayer?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim performs Taraaweeh in congregation in the mosque, and wants to offer more prayers at home, he should pray a series of two-rak'ah prayers and should not repeat witr, because the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"There cannot be two witr prayers in one night.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and others, and deemed saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami', 7565). Umm Salamah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to pray two rak'ahs after witr. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and others, al-Sunan 433). Al-Nawawi said: \"The correct opinion is that he performed the two rak'ahs after witr sitting down, to demonstrate that this is permissible, and he did not do this all the time.\" (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi). The sunnah is to make the last of one's night prayers an odd number of rak'ahs, as is reported (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 943). But if he has already prayed with the imaam, and wants to perform more prayers on his own and has time to do so - especially in the winter - he should do as is outlined above. As regards the number of rak'ahs to be performed in the night prayers, the Sunnah is to perform no more than eleven rak'ahs, because of the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah may Allaah be pleased with her, who said: \"... He never used to pray more than eleven rak'ahs, in Ramadan or at any other time...\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1874). The best way to perform the night prayer is to pray two by two (rak'ahs), and to separate the two even rak'ahs of witr from the one rak'ah (i.e., not to join the three rak'ahs of witr). The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: \"The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to perform the night prayers two by two (rak'ahs), then he would end with a single rak'ah.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 940). This is the best-known way of performing the night prayers according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him); other ways are also known.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. If a Muslim performs taweeh or re-arra'eeh in the congregation in the evening, he should do this; if a Muslim wants to offer additional prayers at home and wants to improve his sermon, then he should pray two-by-two prayers. The Sunnah is not to perform more than eleven \"raak'ahs\" in one night; it is to perform two by two prayers in one day. In addition, the prayer has to be repeated every three hours.",

If my parents tell me to return to my given name (Tyrone-has pagan origins ; Anthony-means flourishing) do I have to do it?",

However, he did change the first names of those who had names with forbidden or undesirable meanings. Because your first name has pagan origins, your changing it to another name, such as Bilaal, is proper and correct.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If a woman finds that she has to work because of necessity, she is permitted to work outside the home, as is indicated by the fact that the two daughters of Shu\u2019ayb used to water the sheep, and the story of Asma\u2019 bint Abi Bakr working outside the home. If a woman is widowed with children, and has no breadwinner and is receiving no money from the Bayt al-Maal (treasury), it is permissible for her to earn a living. Although we say that a woman is permitted to work outside the home when it is necessary, she should nevertheless do only the work she needs to do in order to meet her needs. If a woman has professional skills which not every woman possesses, and which are needed by other woman and society as a whole, then it is permissible for her to practice her profession outside the home, so long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee\u2019ah and has the permission of her legal (shar\u2019i) guardian. The evidence that it is permissible for the woman to work outside the home in a field where there is a need for her work, as long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee\u2019ah, is to be seen in the fact that at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), midwives used to attend women in labour, and skilled women used to practice circumcision, and he did not condemn them for doing so. It is also known that Rufaydah al-Ansaariyyah used to treat the wounded in her tent, which had been set up in the mosque for that purpose. She was very skilled in treating the sick, and her work was done with the knowledge and express permission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Sa\u2019d ibn Mu\u2019aadh was transferred to her tent for treatment. This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to practice her profession outside the home, and by analogy we may deduce that it is permissible for a female doctor to open a clinic outside her home for the treatment of women and children. By doing this, she is fulfilling the duty of fard kifaayah (a duty falling on the entire community \u2013 if some people fulfil it, responsibility is lifted from the rest, otherwise all will be held accountable. Translator). Such clinics make it easy for sick women to come to a female doctor, hence they no longer have to uncover their \u2018awrah before a male doctor when they need treatment. But this permission is given on the condition that this work does not affect her duties towards her own home, husband and children, and that she has her husband\u2019s permission, because these duties are her individual duties (fard \u2018ayn), which take precedence over her responsibilities towards the community (fard kifaayah). When there is any conflict, her individual duties must come first. (Al-Mufassal by \u2018Abd al-Kareem, 4/272). Another hadeeth which describes Muslim women at the beginning of Islam practising a profession was narrated by Hafsah, concerning a woman who used to treat the wounded. Al-Bukhaari, may Allaah have mercy on him, reported in his Saheeh that Hafsah said: \u201cA woman came and stayed at the fort of Bani Khalaf, and told us about her sister. Her sister\u2019s husband used to go out on military campaigns with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He had been on twelve campaigns, and she (his wife) had accompanied him on six. She said, \u2018We used to treat the wounded and take care of the sick...\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 313). But a woman\u2019s work as a nurse or doctor is regulated by the rules indicated in other Islamic texts. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, may Allaah have mercy on him, commenting on the above hadeeth, mentioned some of these conditions: \u201cWhat we learn from this hadeeth is that a woman is allowed to offer medical treatment to a non-mahram man (one to whom she is not related), so long as this takes the form of bringing medicine to him, for example, or other forms of indirect treatment (i.e. with no touching or direct contact involved) \u2013 except in cases where it is necessary and there is no fear of temptation (such as in an emergency situation or in the event of a disaster).\u201d If a woman works in complete hijaab, without touching a male patient, or being alone with him in any way, and as long as there is no fear that she may be the cause of temptation or be tempted herself, and she is not neglecting a more essential duty such as taking care of her husband or children, and she has the permission of her guardian, then it is permissible for her to work. In principle, men should be treated by male doctors and nurses, and women by female doctors and nurses. There should be no mixing of the sexes in medical treatment, except when it is necessary and as long as there is no fear of temptation. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. If a person finds that he/she cannot work because of \"cable\", then she/she should nevertheless do her work, whether it is necessary or not. For example, if a woman has a family member who needs medical attention, then this would be fine; for a married woman, however, it would be against the law to practice medicine outside the home unless she obtains permission from her husband.

To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani, May Allah safeguard you, Judge of Nairobi - Kenya May Allaah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon you. I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what scholars have mentioned: If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the purification of one\u2019s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and good. This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc... Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is considered as lost money that no one owns. Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims. Reference: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/401-411, \"What should one do who repents from earning forbidden money\", Al-Fawzaan.",

The Judge responds by stating that if a Muslim earns or receives unlawful money, then he should get it out of the hands of those who use it, as long as the institution where the money is being spent does not cause any harm or unlawful effects.

Ahlul Kitab (People of the Book) consist of both believers and disbelievers, as indicated in the Quran, where Allah the Almighty mentions the disbelievers among them (interpretation of the meaning): \"O people of the Scripture!: Why do you disbelieve in the verses [about Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)] of Allah, while you (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth).\" (Al \u2018Imraan, 3:70) And: \"Say: O people of the Scripture! Why do you stop those who believe from the path of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do\". (Al \u2018Imran, 3:99) And Allah, the Almighty, said about the believers among them, making clear the difference between them and the aforementioned (interpretation of the meaning): \"Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid evil and they hasten in good works; and they are among the righteous. And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knows well those who are the pious.\" (Al \u2018Imran, 3:113-115) These people also believe in our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Quran which was revealed to him as mentioned (approximate translation of meanings is): \"And there are, certainly, among the people of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They do not sell the Verses of Allah for a little price, for them is a reward from their Lord. Surely, Allah is swift in account.\" (Al \u2018Imran, 3:199) Are modern Christians among Ahul Kitab?

The correct opinion is that Tahiyyat al-masjid is permitted at all times, even after Fajr and after \u2018Asr, because of the general applicability of the hadith \u201cWhen any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak`ahs.\u201d (Sahih \u2013 agreed upon) Tahiyyat al-masjid is one of the prayers that is done for a specific reason, like Salat al-Tawaf (prayer done after circumambulating the Ka`bah) and Salat al-Kusuf (prayer at the time of an eclipse).

For example, let's suppose the man in question left property and wealth with a total worth of $88,000, and he does not owe payment on any loans and did not specify any special requests or instructions to make particular donations in his will. Thus, the division would be as follows: For the wife, an eighth, 1/8 of 88,000 which is $11,000. The remaining 77,000 is divided into 11 equal portions, 1/11 * 77,000 = $7,000 So each son is entitled to two portions, or 2 * 7,000 = $14,000 And each daughter is entitled to $7,000.",

        "question": "Assalam O Alikium My mother is planning to go to ummrah inshallah. But she needs a mairram and her husband nor her brothers are able to go. We have asked an alm he said she can go with her brother in-law which is also her first cousin. As long as his wife is there which she will be cause she's going too. Is this permissable in Islam because I still have my doubts. Jazak allah ho karun.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.One of the ways in which Islam protects women is that it requires a woman to travel with a mahram, to protect her from those who have bad intentions and to help her, because of her weakness, in facing the arduous trials of travelling. A woman is not permitted to travel without a mahram because of the hadeeth narrated by Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A woman should absolutely not travel unless she has a mahram with her. A man stood up and said, O Messenger of Allaah, I have enlisted in such-and-such a military campaign, and my wife has set out for Hajj. He said, Go and do Hajj with your wife. (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 3006). What indicates that a mahram is obligatory is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded this man to give up the idea of jihaad (on this occasion), even though he had enlisted for a campaign and his wife was travelling for the purpose of worship, not for some frivolous or suspicious reason. In spite of all this, he told him to go and do Hajj with his wife. The ulamaa have listed five conditions for a person to be considered a mahram. He should be male, Muslim, adult, and of sound mind, and he should be a relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a father, brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, father in law, mothers husband or brother through radaaah (breastfeeding), etc. (as opposed to relatives to whom marriage is temporarily forbidden, such as a sisters husband, paternal aunts husband, maternal aunts husband). On this basis, the husbands brother and the son of a paternal or maternal uncle are not mahrams, so it is not permitted for her to travel with them. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "The ulamaa, which is the five conditions that a person can be considered a \" mahram,\" is that he or she should be able to travel with him or her without having to wear a mahram on his or her shoulders. A man who enlisted in a military campaign and had his wife accompanying him to go to Hajj has told his Messenger of Allaah that he cannot travel unless he has a woman with him. In other words, this man will have to give up all the pretense of going to do hajj because his wife is travelling for the religious purpose of worship. This man also tells his wife to go and conduct Hajj with him even though he himself has enlisted in such a campaign, and his wife has left for the pilgrimage. He asks his wife not to go into Hajj without him, and she does so without him. It is clear that the Prophet commands this man to abandon the idea of wearing a jiwaad, even though it was an honorable thing to do.",

        "question": "My Question About Taharah for women after childbirth. My wife kept bleeding after our child birth for exactly 56 days that is 16 days more than usual. Could you give us details about what she should consider those extra 16 days. some says that it might be her period (Dawrah ), some said it is estihathah. other said it is a collection of Dawrah and estihathah. We have Sheikh Mohmmed bin Saleh Al-Othaimeen book \" Al-dema'a Al-tabeeiyah\", but we did not realy understand exactly what he means.How do we know that it is her periond or it is not?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There is a dispute amongst the religious scholars regarding the longest period of nifaas (the post-natal bleeding period). Some scholars say it is forty (40) days, others say it is sixty (60) days and some say there is no limit to the maximum number of days a woman can be a in a state of nifaas. The most predominate opinion is that the maximum period is forty (40) days according to what is narrated by Umm Salama. Umm Salama said \"The nufasaa' (a woman in a state of birth blood discharge) used to continue to be in childbed for forty days at the time of the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him.\" Al-Tirmidhi reported: \"It is unanimously agreed upon among religious scholars from the sahaabah (companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him) and al-taabi'oon (those who had met only a companion of the Prophet, but not the Prophet himself) that the nufasaa' does not pray for forty days unless she sees tuhr (blood stoppage) before the end of the forty days period. She should then perform ghusl (ablution of the whole body) and she resumes praying. The majority of the religious scholars say that a woman does pray even If she continues to notice blood after the forty days period expires and this is the opinion of the majority of fuqahaa' (religious scholars) among whom Sufian Al-Thawry, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaaq.\" Sunan Al-Tirmidhi hadeeth # 139. The same hadeeth is also reported by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Al-Daraami and is classified as hasan by Al-Albaani in Irwaa' Al-Ghaleel # 201. Al-Albaani has supported this narration by another hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood narrated by Umm Salama who said, \"A Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) wife used to remain in (a state of) nifaas for forty nights and the Prophet would not ask her to make up the prayers she missed during the period of nifaas\". Ibn Majah also reported that Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, narrated that \"The Prophet had specified a period of forty days for the nufasaa' unless she achieves tuhr before that.\" Irwaa' Al Ghaleel # 223-222/1. Therefore, if a woman experiencing post-childbirth bleeding spent forty days and she still sees blood, then we consider this blood as istihaadha (womb bleeding between periods) which does not stop a woman from performing prayer (salaat) nor fasting (siyaam), unless the end of the forty days coincides with the regular menstrual period (dawrah); in this case she would consider this blood as menstrual blood. Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "There is some debate among the religious scholars over the length of the nifaas, or pre-natal bleeding time. Some scholars think it is 40 days, others says it is 60 (60), some say it is 160 (232) days, and some say a woman should perform ablution before she stops praying. The consensus among religious scholars is that forty days is the maximum amount of time a woman can spend in a \"waas\". There is also disagreement amongst the scholars regarding the shortest period of post-nifaas. Some believe it is forty days; others, however, believe it to be sixty-60 days. All opinions are those of the scholar who have not yet met with him.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The reasons are: Wasting of time in something which has no benefit in this life nor in the hereafter. This game of cards is based on the idea of gambling, and it resembles playing with dice, which is clearly prohibited in Islaam, as related in the authentic hadeeth of the Prophet : \"Whoever plays with dice, would (resemble) one who has tainted his hand with the flesh and blood of a pig,\" narrated by Muslim (2260). The playing cards include pictures of creations with a soul (the Jack and Queen ). The rancor, enmity, bitterness, and/or ill-feeling which may occur between the players (shahnaa' wa-baghdaa'). The game promotes cheating, deception, and trickery (ghish wa-tahaayul). It distracts from the worship of Allaah, and from salaat. Even if one performs salaat on time, and with the congregation in the Masjid, how would he escape the hadeeth of the Prophet : \"Everything other than remembering Allah is (considered) wasteful play except four: a man humoring his wife, a man training his horse, a man walking between targets (learning archery), and man learning swimming,\" narrated by An-Nasaa'i and authenticated by Al-Albaani (Sahih Al-Jami' 4534).",

My wife has tried a number of times to re-establish contact yet her mother refuses, quite stubbornly, to reply. We are both reverts and have often felt that our acceptance of the religion has played some part in her mother's negative attitude. I would be grateful if you could advise us on what me might possibly do to rectify this situation. Jazak Allahu Khairan",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah., The reactions of non-muslim mothers towards their children's embracement of Islam varies. Some mothers are peaceful and passive considering this as a personal matter which does not affect the relationship between the mother and her son or daughter. In such cases more piety by the child towards his or her mother will make the mother admire and respect Islam. Other mothers adopts a more stubborn approach at the beginning but the mother finally gives in and accepts the new religion as a fact of life after she sees the child's determination and persistence which could lead the mother herself to embrace Islam. In the third case we find that some mothers are constantly stubborn to the extent that she might hurt and oppress her son or daughter. Usually such mothers are blindly prejudice because they consider that her son or daughter had gone astray by leaving the faith of his fathers and ancestors and she must do something to help go back to the right path (according to the mother). The following are three stories that took place at the time of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that involved three of the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) which illustrates the reactions of their mothers after they embraced Islam: Story #1 On the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said \"My mother came to visit me one day. At that time she was still a polytheist and there was a pledge between the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, and Quraish (one of the great tribes in Arabia that lived in Mecca in the pre Islamic Period of Ignorance who used to enjoy great spiritual and financial powers). I requested the Prophet's, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, religious verdict and said: Oh Prophet of Allah, my mother came to visit me, seeking my help; should I keep a good relationship with her? Yes, keep a good relation with her said the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him:. Reported by Bukhari and Muslim, and this narration is listed in Sahih Muslim under # 1003. In another version narrated by Ahmad, on the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said \" My mother came to visit me when she was still a polytheist and she was living amongst Quraish. She was desirous, meaning in need, so I asked the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, and said: Oh Prophet of Allah my mother came to me and she is a polytheist and she needs help. Should I keep a good relationship with her? He said yes maintain a good relationship with her. Story #2 On the authority of Abu-Huraira, who said: I used to call my mother to Islam when she was still a polytheist. One day, while I was calling her she mentioned something about the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that I detested. So I went to see the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, while crying and told him: I used to call my mother to Islam and she would refuse. I called her today and she mentioned something about you that I detested. Please invoke the blessings and guidance of Allah on her. Then the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: O Great Allah guide the mother of Abu-Huraira. So I left full of hope because of the Prophet's supplication for my mother. When I reached home I found that the door was partially closed. My mother heard my footsteps and said: Stay still Abu-Huraira, then I heard the water running; he added my mother performed body ablution, put on her cloths and hurriedly opened the door without her head-cover and said: \"None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, is the Messenger of Allah\". I went back to the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, crying of joy and told him: I am bringing you good news; Allah answered your prayers and guided the mother of Abu-Huraira. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, praised and glorified Allah and said: this is good. I said: Oh Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me and my mother beloved by Allah's believing slaves and make us love them. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: Oh Allah, make this little slave of Yours and his mother (meaning Abu-Huraira and his mother) become beloved by your believing slaves and make the believers love them. Ever since, there was not a believer who heard of me, even without seeing me, that did not love me. Reported by Muslim in Sahih Muslim (Muslim Authentic volumes) under # 2491. Story # 3 On the authority of Saa'd (Ibn Abi Waqas May Allah be pleased with him) who said that verses of the Qur'an revealed his story. He said Um Saa'd (his mother) swore not to talk to him ever nor eat or drink until he renounces Islam. She said: You claim that Allah commanded you to obey your parents. I am your mother and I order you to do this ( to renounce Islam). He said: She stayed with nothing to eat or drink for three days until she fainted because of strain. Then one of her other sons named Umarah gave her water to drink. And she started to imprecate against Saa'd, then Allah revealed this verse in the Qur'an, which translates to the meaning of And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do Verse 29:8 - Surah 29, Al Ankabut. This Hadith is narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and in Sahih Muslim in his Sahih under # 1748. Also, Allah revealed another verse in the Qur'an, which translates to: \"But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that if which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do\"( 31:15 - Surah Luqman). Based on the above stories one can determine how to deal with a non believing mother and can draw the following significant conclusions: The importance of good presentation of Islam to the non believing mother and to try to kindly persuade her and to strive to convince her as Abu Huraira did (story # 1) Continue to do good to the non believing mother and to remember that her disbelief does not justify disobedience by the son or daughter and that doing her good does not contradict with your innocence of her as a non believer, on the contrary as it is stated in Verse 31:15 above, Allah has commanded us to treat the non believing parents kindly even if they strive to make their child a polytheist because of their rights as parents hoping that they will embrace Islam. Continue to sincerely pray and supplicate for the non believing mother hoping that Allah may guide her, as evident in Abu Huraira's story (story #2). The divine guidance of Allah may come after continuous strive by the child and strong objection of the mother as in Abu Huraira's story, therefore the son should never surrender or give up but should continue to pray and supplicate for the non believing mother. Regardless of how hard does the non believing mother strive to make the son renounces Islam, and the pressure she will exercise against her son such as refusing to eat or invoking upon him, the son should never surrender or give in nor should he retrocede away from the righteous path as one of the Sahaba said to his non believing mother in a similar situation: :If you had one hundred (100) souls and it all left your body one after the other I will never give up my religion (Islam)\". It seems that the mother in question deliberately oppresses her daughter through estrangement which makes her emotional torn but that should never weaken the muslim or shake his faith and belief in his religion. There is no objection to make the non believing mother understand that you are not going to retrocede, however she (the mother) can kindly ask for anything and she will be immediately answered to it except for giving up this religion. We ask Allah to quickly guide her to the righteous path and give you patience to call her to Islam and lead you to the righteous and correct way.",
        "summary": "This chapter is a collection of three stories that tell the story of three different mothers who relate their mothers' reactions to their children's conversion to Islam. The first story involves an unidentified polytheist whose mother comes to visit him one day seeking his help. She refuses to speak to him, eats or drink until renunciation. The narrator then tells her story of how she came to visit her mother and how she refused to talk to her husband until he renounced his religion.

        "question": "Allah mentions in the Quran that when an evil befalls us it is due to what our own hands have earned. Also our beloved Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a hadeeth (report) that the most tried are the Prophets, then those in piety after those. So therefore in our day to day life when things go wrong in our lives, how do we decide whether it is due to our sinfulness or that Allah loves us and therefore sends a trial upon us?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Punishments are what happen to people in return for their evil deeds. Trials are tests which are sent to try people, and people may be tested by good things or by bad. Concerning punishments, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cWhatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself...\u201d [al-Nisa 4:79] Concerning the phrase \u201cis from yourself\u201d, Qatadah said: \u201c[It means] the punishment is for you, O son of Adam, because of your sin.\u201d Abu Salih said that \u201cwhatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself\u201d means \u201cbecause of your sin, and I [Allah] am the One Who decreed it for you.\u201d (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). Allah also says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.\u201d [al-Shoora 42:30] Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \u201c[It means] whatever misfortune happens to you, O people, is because of evil deeds that you have already done, and \u2018He pardons much\u2019 refers to evil deeds \u2013 He does not punish you for them but He pardons them. \u2018And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, he would not leave a moving (living) creature on the surface of the earth...\u2019 [Fatir 35:45 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].\u201d Concerning trials, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cIf Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever has patience will have patience, and whoever is anxious will be anxious.\u201d (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad; Saheeh al-Jami\u2019, 1706). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: \u201cThe extent of the reward will be in accordance with the extent of the trial. If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever is content will have contentment, and whoever is angry will have anger.\u201d (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2320; Saheeh al-Jami\u2019, 2210). The following outlines how one may tell whether a given event is a punishment or a trial: If the misfortune results from doing an act of obedience to Allah, such as being wounded in jihad, or losing money when migrating for the sake of Allah, or losing a job because of becoming a Muslim or increasing one\u2019s commitment to Islam, then this is a trial. Whoever bears it with patience will be rewarded, but if one reacts angrily then one will earn the wrath of Allah. If the misfortune results from sin, such as sexually-transmitted diseases or illnesses caused by drinking alcohol and taking drugs, and so on, then this is the kind of punishment that comes in this world (as opposed to being deferred until the Hereafter). If the misfortune is connected neither to a good deed nor a sin \u2013 such as other kinds of diseases and sicknesses, losing a child, or failing in business \u2013 then it depends on the person\u2019s situation. If he is good and devout, it is a trial, and if he is sinful, it is a punishment. The misfortune may be a punishment to atone for sins, or it may be a trial aimed at raising a person\u2019s status and increasing his hasanat (good deeds/rewards) \u2013 this may be determined by whether a person is obedient or disobedient. A person should not praise himself, rather he should criticize himself for his shortcomings and strive to attain perfection. He will benefit from misfortunes in any case, if he has patience and hopes for reward. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is given to Allah, who says that punishment is what happens to people when they return for their good deeds. He also tells us that trials are tests, which are sent by Allah to try people and people will be tested either by good or by evil. In particular, the Prophet uses the phrase \"is from yourself\" interchangeably with the term \"poisoned.\" The Prophet also makes it clear that he does not punish people for their bad deeds, but he pardons those who have already done them. Punishments do not refer to evil deeds; rather, they refer to good deeds that have already been done. If Allah rewards a person because of his good deeds, then there is no punishment for his evil deeds. When trials happen, there can be no punishment. People will be judged by how well they respond to them.",

We have talked about marriage and both agree we want to spend our lives together.Now here is where the problem begins.Her father would not agree to marry her to anyone but a XXX that he has chosen in an arranged marriage.Even if she doesnt love him. I have spoken to her mother and she really likes me.She tried to talk to her husband but he wouldnt listen.Now it looks like her dad will arrange a marriage for her soon. What can we DO!!!I dont want to lose her I love her soooo much.Is there anything we can do?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.besides Whom there is nobody to praise when calamity strikes. My dear brother, you should realize that no calamity befalls a person except because of sin, and it cannot be lifted except by repentance. Despite all the hardship you are facing and the intense pain you are feeling, you still have to think about the root of the problem and understand the shar\u2019i ruling on it and learn a lesson from what has happened. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself...\u201d [al-Nisa\u2019 4:79] it comes from yourself because you gave yourself free rein in starting this forbidden relationship and getting to know this girl in a manner that is not approved of in sharee\u2019ah, and because you indulged in absolute freedom in an environment that is far removed from the laws of Allaah. Don\u2019t you see that our Lord is truly Wise and All-Knowing when He forbids men to deliberately look at non-mahram women or to touch them or be alone with them or take them as friends? Allaah knows that this leads to haraam things whether it is immoral actions of varying decrees or falling in love \u2013 which is the serious and fatal disease from which you are suffering because of your sin. You have become one of its victims, suffering its pain and choking on it. You have been very frank in describing this disease from its onset, and how you fell into this devilish trap, when you said in your question: \u201cI have met a wonderful Muslim girl six months ago... We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other.\u201d But you mention that you feel that Allaah has led you to one another. If you mean that this has happened by the will and decree of Allaah, then this is correct. Even Iblees exists by the will and decree of Allaah. But if you meant that Allaah decreed this because He likes it and approves of it, (this is wrong, because) Allaah does not approve of anything that is haraam. Just because something happens does not mean that Allaah likes it or approves of it. Allaah decrees good and evil for reasons which only He knows. If you say now that what has happened has happened, and cannot be changed, so what can we do about this father who is standing in the way of these two lovers who want to get married? I would say that there is nothing wrong with making efforts \u2013 in halaal ways, of course \u2013 to persuade this father, such as bringing mediators from within the family, or the imaam of the Islamic Centre where the father goes, and so on, and praying earnestly to Allaah to make this girl part of your lot in life if this is good for you and for her. If what you want happens, then praise be to Allaah, Who is the Giver of bounty and blessings. But if all attempts fail, mediation does not work and the wind blows in the way that the sailor does not like (i.e., things do not go the way you hoped), then you should know that from the point of view of sharee\u2019ah you can never marry this girl without the consent of her guardian \u2013 which is her father in the case \u2013 because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAny woman who gets married without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.\u201d (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1102, and by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 2709). The marriage contract will not be valid even if it was approved by jaahili courts and kaafir judges. It is impossible for running away with this girl to be a valid solution, either in this world or in the next. We must also ask some other questions raised by your situation, such as: what is your commitment to Islam \u2013 do you pray regularly, for example? Does she adhere to the hijaab prescribed by sharee\u2019ah? What is the attitude of your own family to the idea of your marrying this girl? Finally, you must realize that you will have to forget about her if she marries someone else. In that case, you should not waste your life regretting losing her. You never know where good may come from. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:216] What has happened is a mistake of which you are going to bear the bitter consequences, but you have to be sincere towards Allaah and strive to repent and turn back to Him. If this girl is not destined to be your lot in life, then we ask Allaah to compensate you with someone better than her. \u201cVerily, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him, and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the reward of the muhsinoon (good-doers) to be lost.\u201d [Yoosuf 12:90 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].",
        "summary": "Your dear brother, this chapter is dedicated to you. You should realize that there is no calamity because of sin; it comes from your sinful nature. It comes from the fact that you allowed yourself to start this forbidden relationship with this Muslim girl and then get to know her in a way that was not approved of sharee'ah, and which prevented you from falling in love with her. The narrator also tells us that under the halal circumstances, marriage can be invalid if it is approved by jahsili courts or kaafirs judges.",

I hope you can help and I hope Allah will forgive me if it is inappropriate but as Muslims we should never be shy in seeking knowledge. Her question was \"Is it permissible in Islam to masturbate?\" May Allah increase us all in knowledge!",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Is masturbation haram in Islam? Masturbation (for both men and women) is haraam (forbidden) in Islam based on the following evidence: Prohibition of masturbation in the Quran Al-Imam Shafi'i stated that masturbation is forbidden based on the following verses from the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.} (Al-Muminun 23:5-7) Here the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts (including masturbation) except for the wives or what their right hand possesses. {And whoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.} Some scholars used as evidence the ayah (in meaning), {And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His bounty.} (Al-Nur 24:33) This verse also clearly orders whoever does not have the financial means to marry to keep himself chaste and be patient in facing temptations (including masturbation) until Allah enriches them of His bounty. Prohibition of masturbation in the Sunnah 'Abdullaah ibn Mas\u2019ud said, \"We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while we were young and had no wealth whatsoever. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said, 'O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.'\" (Al-Bukhari 5066) The hadeeth orders men who are not able to marry to fast despite the hardship encountered in doing so, and not to masturbate despite the ease with which it can be done. There is additional evidence that can be cited to support this ruling on masturbation, but due to the limited space we will not go through them here. Tips on how to give up masturbation As for curing/treating the habit of masturbation, we recommend the following suggestions: 1. The motive to seek a cure for this problem should be solely following Allah's orders and fearing His punishment. 2. A permanent and quick cure from this problem lies in marriage as soon as the person is able, as shown in the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) hadeeth. 3. Keeping oneself busy with what is good for this world and the Hereafter is essential in breaking this habit before it becomes second nature after which it is very difficult to rid oneself of it. 4. Lowering the gaze (from looking at forbidden things such as pictures, movies etc.) will help suppress the desire before it leads one to commit the haram (forbidden). Allah orders men and women to lower their gaze as shown in the following two verses and in the Prophet's hadith. {Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is all-aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.)..... } (24: 30-31) Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Do not follow a casual (unintentional) look (at forbidden things) with another look.\" (Al-Tirmidhi, 2777) This is a general instruction by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to abstain from all that may sexually excite a person because it might lead him/her to commit the haram (forbidden). 5. Using one's available leisure time in worshipping Allah and increasing religious knowledge. 6. Being cautious not to develop any of the medical symptoms that may result from masturbation such as weak eyesight, weak nervous system, and/or back pain. More importantly, feelings of guilt and anxiety that can be complicated by missing obligatory prayers because of the need to shower (ghusl) after every incidence of masturbation, especially in the winter, and the invalidating of the fast. 7. Avoiding the illusion that some youth have that masturbation is permissible because it prevents them from committing illegal sexual acts such as fornication or even homosexuality, while they may not be at the gates of that immorality to begin with. 8. Strengthening one's willpower and not surrendering to the shaytan, and avoiding spending time alone as recommended by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he said \"Do not spend the night alone\" Ahmad, 6919. 9. Following the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) aforementioned hadeeth and fasting when possible, because fasting will temper one's sexual desire and keep it under control. However, one should not overreact and swear by Allah not to return to the act because if one does not honor one's promise, one would be facing the consequences of not living up to one's oath to Allah. Also, note that medication to diminish one's sexual desire is strictly prohibited because it might permanently affect one's sexual ability. 10. Trying to follow the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) recommendation concerning the etiquette of getting ready for bed, such as reading the well-known supplications, sleeping on the right side, and avoiding sleeping on the belly (the Prophet-peace and blessings be upon him- forbade sleeping on the belly). 11. Striving hard to be patient and chaste, because persistence will eventually, Allah willing, lead to attaining those qualities as second nature, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) explains in the following hadith: \"Whoever seeks chastity Allah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks help from none but Allah, He will help him, and whoever is patient He will make it easy for him, and no one has ever been given anything better than patience.\" Al-Bukhari:1469. 12. If one falls into this sin, they must hasten to repent, asking forgiveness from Allah, doing good deeds, and not losing hope and feeling despair; these are all prerequisites to curing this problem. Note that losing hope is one of the major sins punishable by Allah. 13. Finally, Allah is the Most Merciful and He always responds to whoever calls on Him. So, asking for Allah's forgiveness and help will be accepted, by His will. For more about the issues related to masturbation, please see these answers: 826, 27112 and 245978 And Allah knows best",
        "summary": "Prologue: Prologue discusses the prohibition of masturbation in this chapter. It is based on the interpretation of the Hadith, which states that masturbation is a sin and that it should not be taken seriously until it is completely eliminated. The narrator also quotes from several sources, including al-Hasani, Al-Ahram, al-Jabbar, and other scholars who have written extensively on the subject. In general, the narrator feels that there are no hard feelings or anxieties in the world as a whole. However, he does note that some people may feel guilty about indulging in immoral or illegal sexual acts. He also notes that alcohol and tobacco are considered to be bad for one's sex drive.",

        "question": "Asalaamulaikum respected brother, Insha'Allah, you may be able to help me answer these questions for a friend of mine. What is Islam's view on the parents' (especially the father's) responsibility to educate their children? Additionally, what type or manner of education is most Islamically correct (i.e. private or public school etc.)?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. Praise be to Allaah. No doubt that a child's education is one of life's necessities, and as such spending to achieve it is obligatory on the parents. However, the level of education that a Muslim should provide for his children is not necessarily the highest level possible. This is because a child can lead a perfectly normal life with only, for example, high school education. And as for whether private schools are better than public schools from the shari'ah (Islamic jurisprudence) standpoint, I do not think that there is a general rule by which we can favor one schooling system over the other. It all depends on the specifics of each individual case when assessed with respect to curricula, teachers' skills, and the school district credibility. Wallaahu a'lam. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. As for whether a Muslim's education is the best or the lowest level possible, I don't think that we can judge one schooling system by its merits. It just depends on the individual case. For example, if a child has only one high school education, then it doesn't matter how good the private school is, as long as the quality of the public school is also up there with the acceptable ones. The same goes for a child who has only, say, a middle school education. In other words, a Muslim shouldn't be spending too much on one particular schooling system over another.",

        "question": "As Salam Wahalakum, Can we pray salat while in a moving car that's because there is no place to stop and pray?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Performing prayers at the right time is a trust and an obligation, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Verily, al-Salaat (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.\" [al-Nisaa' 4:103]. Delaying the prayer past its appointed time is a grave major sin, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"So woe unto those performers of salaat (prayers) (hypocrites), who delay their salaat from their stated fixed times.\" [al-Maa'oon 107:4-5] Some scholars state that the person who deliberately misses one prayer and leaves it until the appointed time is over, with no excuse, is a kaafir. Claiming that one cannot find a place to pray is not a valid excuse, because either one is living on the face of the earth or not, and if one is living on the face of the earth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The (whole) earth has been made a mosque (or a place of prayer) and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man of my ummah may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 335) According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: \"The (whole) earth has been made good for me, a means of purification and a mosque (or place of prayer); so wherever a man may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray wherever he is.\" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 521) The entire world is a suitable place to prostrate oneself; the scholars have made no exceptions except very few, such as graveyards and lavatories. Wherever a Muslim is when the time for prayer comes, he should pray: in a mosque, if possible, or else in a hallway or park, on a sidewalk or in a parking lot, or in a corner of a store. Even if one can find no other place than a church, it is permissible to pray in it. As far as praying on board means of transportation is concerned, then it is possible to pray there so long as the necessary conditions of prayer are fulfilled, or else one can wait until one gets out of the vehicle. If waiting means that the time for the prayer will pass, then you should pray in the best way that you can. Let us assume, for example, that you are in a car or train where there is no place to pray, you cannot stop and pray at the side of the road, and the time for that prayer is running out. In such a situation, the Muslim should pray in the best way that he can, even if he is sitting in his seat and even if he is not facing the qiblah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can\" [al-Taghaabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If I have commanded you to do something, do as much of it as you can.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 7288) An exception to be above is naafil (supererogatory) prayers offered when riding a camel, which is permissible even if one cannot get down or if one is not facing the qiblah. This is known from the report of Ibn 'Umar, who said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray when travelling on his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, and he would gesture with his head to indicate the movements of the night prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray witr on his camel too.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 945) Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray voluntary (nafl) prayers when riding on his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, when he came from Makkah to Madeenah.\" Then Ibn 'Umar recited this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \"And to Allaah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces, there is the Face of Allaah (and He is High above, over His Throne)\" [al-Baqarah 2:115] Ibn 'Umar said: \"It was concerning this that this aayah was revealed.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2883; he said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth) We should not forget to point out here that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries sometimes delay or abandon their prayers for another, completely different, reason, which is that they feel too embarrassed to pray in front of the kuffaar in public or open places, or they are afraid that they will make fun of them and regard them as odd. This is a serious mistake. How can a Muslim feel embarrassed about proclaiming the truth and worshipping openly, hastening to fulfil the command of Allaah at the time when Allaah has said it is to be done? This matter has been dealt with in a similar question on this website (see question # 980). We ask Allaah to help us all to remember Him, to be grateful to Him and to worship Him properly.",
        "summary": "Preaching and performing prayers in the right time Is a Trust and an obligation. However, it is a major sin to miss one prayer or leave it until its appointed time because of the trust and obligation that Allaah places on people who perform prayers at fixed times. Some scholars claim that the person purposely misses one prayer; others state that he/she deliberately leaves one prayer before the appointed time; however, these scholars do not list naafil prayers offered when traveling on a camel; instead, they include \"superogatory\" prayers offered while riding a camel.",

Ibn Al-Qayyim (Allah's mercy upon him) said about the benefit of shaving the newborn's hair : \u201cShaving his head removes the harm from him, removes the weak hair so that stronger and firmer hair replaces it and it is beneficial for the head. In addition, it comforts the newborn and opens the head's skin openings... And along with this is a strengthening of his eyesight, his sense of smell and hearing.

        "question": "Many people are concerned about their childrens unstable characters and the effects of luxury on their personalities. How can we introduce strength and honour into our childrens characters?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. The issue referred to in the question is one of the most serious problems in raising children nowadays. Some of the Islamic solutions to this problem and ways of instilling strength and honour in our childrens character are listed below:Takniyyah (using the kunya or patronymic in addressing children) Calling a young boy \"Abu Foolaan\" (\"Father of so-and-so) or a young girl \"Umm Foolaan\" (\"Mother of so-and-so\") will make the child feel more responsible and grown up, so he will become more mature and will feel above normal childishness. The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to give kunyas to children. Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was the best of people in attitude and manners. I had a brother whom people used to call Abu Umayr. I think he was just past the age of weaning, and whenever he came along the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) would say to him, O Abu Umayr, what did the nughayr do (Ya Abaa Umayr ma faala al-nuhgayr)?\" (The nughayr was a small bird with which he used to play). (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5735). Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was given some clothes, among which was a small black garment made of silk, known as a khameesah. He said, \"Who do you think I should give this to?\" The people were silent, then he said, \"Bring me Umm Khaalid\" and she was carried to him (which indicates that she was very young). He picked up the garment and put it on her, saying, \"Enjoy it until it wears out.\" There was a green or yellow spot on it, and he said, \"O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah\" sanaah means \"beautiful\" in Ethiopian. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5375). According to another report also narrated by al-Bukhaari: \"He looked at the khameesah and pointed to it, saying, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa.\" Sanaa in Ethiopian means beautiful. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5397).Taking them to gatherings and letting them sit with grown-ups This will increase their understanding and wisdom, and make them try to imitate adults, as well as keeping them from spending too much time on games and entertainment. The Sahaabah used to bring their children with them when they went and sat with the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). One of the stories that describe this was narrated by Muaawiyah ibn Qurrah from his father, who said: \"The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to sit with a group of his Companions. One man had his little son with him; he would bring him from behind and make him sit in front of him\" (Reported by al-Nisaai and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaaiz).Talking to them about the heroic deeds of earlier and subsequent generations, Islamic battles and Muslim victories This will encourage them to be brave, which is one of the most important parts of being strong and honourable. Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam had two children, one of whom was present at some of the battles, and the other of whom used to play with the old battle scars on his fathers shoulder. This was reported by Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, who said that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said to al-Zubayr on the day of Yarmook, \"Will you go and attack, and we will go with you?\" He said, \"If I attacked, you would be lying.\" They said, \"No, we will do (as we promised).\" So he launched an attack (against the Romans), penetrating their ranks and passing straight through, but no one was with him. Then he turned around and came back, and the Romans seized the reins of his horse and wounded him twice in the shoulder. Between these two new wounds was a scar from a wound he had received at Badr. Urwah said, \"When I was little, I used to play by putting my fingers in those scars.\" Urwah said, \" Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr was with him on that day. He was ten years old. He (al-Zubayr) put him on a horse and entrusted him to the care of another man.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3678). Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"Al-Zubayr felt that his son Abdullaah was brave and chivalrous, so he put him on a horse, but he feared that he might attempt to do more than he was able, so he put another man with him so that he could feel that he was safe from the attacks of the Romans should he become distracted by the fighting.\" Ibn al-Mubaarak reported from Hishaam ibn Urwah from his father from Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr that he was with his father on the day of Yarmook, and when the mushrikoon (pagans)ran away, he attacked and started killing their wounded, i.e., he finished off every wounded soldier whom he found. This indicates that he was strong and brave from childhood.Teaching them good manners Among the manners that should be taught are those described in the hadeeth (prophetic narration) narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him): \"The young should greet the old, the passerby should greet one who is sitting, and the small group should greet the larger group.\" (Al-Bukhaari, 5736).Giving them the praise and respect they deserve in front of others This is made clear by the following hadeeth: Sahl ibn Sad (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was brought a cup and he drank from it. There was a boy, the youngest of all the people, on his right and some elders on his left. He said, \"O young boy, will you allow me to give this to these elders?\" The boy said, \"I will not give away my share of your blessings to anyone, O Messenger of Allaah,\" so he gave the cup to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2180)Teaching them manly sports - such as archery, swimming and horse riding.Avoiding humilating them, especially in front of others Never belittling their ideas, and encouraging them to take partConsulting them and asking for their opinionsGiving them responsibilities in accordance with their age and abilitiesTeaching them to be brave as appropriate including how to speak in publicMaking sure their clothes are modest and protecting them from inappropriate clothing, hairstyles, movements and ways of walkingMaking sure that boys do not wear silk, as this is only for womenAvoiding extravagance, luxury, laziness and idleness Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever.\"Avoiding entertainment or pastime gatherings, singing, music and other wastes of time, because these go against strength, honour and seriousness These are some of the ways and means which will increase strength and honour, and protect our children. Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.",
        "summary": "This chapter is dedicated to praising Allah, the author of this book, for his understanding and guidance in teaching and protecting our children. He believes that there can be some effective ways to help children develop their character. For example, using kunya as a patronymic to refer to children will make them feel responsible and grown-up, so they will grow up and become more mature. In addition, calling a young boy 'Abdullaah' or \"Umm foolaan\" or \"Mother of So-and-So\" will make him feel more responsible, so he will rise above childishness. These are all practical solutions to the problem of raising children. Allowing them to sit with the Prophet. Encouraging them to learn about history. Giving them good manners. The Prophet gives them praise and respect throughout the day. Tazza bin Abd al-Rahman reports from his father that the Prophet has killed every Roman soldier whom he finds on the battlefield during Yarmook. This indicates strong and courageous behavior from childhood. Teaching them self-sacrifice. Learning how to be good citizens.Teach them manners. We're not talking about fancy clothes, but we're talking about manners. It's important to note that these are just some of the best things in the book.Teaching kids good manners When they are young, they should greet elders and passersby. They should also greet one another. If they are older than ten years old, then they should treat each other with respect. And speaking of respect, let's not over-indulge them.",

        "question": "My question is : IS the taking of PHOTOGRAPHS ALLOWED,(I know drawing pictures of living things is not allowed -but what about taking photograph's of people etc.), can you supply me with some evidence please. I need this information quickly.- Inshallah.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Photography (tasweer) means the taking of pictures of living, animate moving beings, like people, animals, birds, etc. The ruling is that it is forbidden on the basis of a number of reports, such as the following: 'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Those who will be most severely punished by Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/382). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah, may He be exalted, says: 'Who does more wrong than the one who tries to create something like My creation? Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of corn.'\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see Fath al-Baari, 10/385). 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any built-up tomb without levelling it, and do not leave any picture in any house without erasing it.\" (Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaa'i; this is the version narrated by al-Nisaa'i). Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and for every image that he made a soul will be created for him, which will be punished in the Fire.\" Ibn 'Abbaas said: \"If you must do that, make pictures of trees and other inanimate objects.\" (Reported by Muslim, 3/1871) These ahaadeeth indicate that pictures of animate beings are haraam, whether they are humans or other creatures, whether they are three-dimensional or two-dimensional, whether they are printed, drawn, etched, engraved, carved, cast in moulds, etc. These ahaadeeth include all of these types of pictures. The Muslim should submit to the teachings of Islam and not argue with them by saying, \"But I am not worshipping them or prostrating to them!\" If we think about just one aspect of the evil caused by the prevalence of photographs and pictures in our times, we will understand something of the wisdom behind this prohibition: that aspect is the great corruption caused by the provoking of physical desires and subsequent spread of immorality caused by these pictures. The Muslim should not keep any pictures of animate beings in his house, because they will prevent the angels from entering. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/380). But nowadays, unfortunately, one can even find in some Muslim homes statues of gods worshipped by the kuffaar (such as Buddha etc.) which they keep on the basis that they are antiques or decorative pieces. These things are more strictly prohibited than others, just as pictures which are hung up are worse than pictures which are not hung up, for how easily they can lead to glorification, and cause grief or be a source of boasting! We cannot say that these pictures are kept for memory's sake, because true memories of a Muslim relative or friend reside in the heart, and we remember them by praying for mercy and forgiveness for them. Taking pictures with a camera involves human actions such as focusing, pressing the shutter, developing, printing, and so on. We cannot call it anything other than \"picture-making\" or tasweer, which is the expression used by all Arabic-speakers to describe this action. In the book Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam, the author says: \"Photography is even more of an imitation of the creation of Allaah than pictures which are engraved or drawn, so it is even more deserving of being prohibited There is nothing that could exclude photography from the general meaning of the reports.\" (p. 42, see also Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/355). Among the scholars who have discussed the issue of photography is Shaykh Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, who said: \"Some of them differentiate between hand-drawn pictures and photographic images by claiming that the latter are not products of human effort, and that no more is involved than the mere capturing of the image. This is what they claim. The tremendous energy invested the one who invented this machine that can do in few seconds what otherwise could not be done in hours does not count as human effort, according to these people! Pointing the camera, focusing it, and taking the picture, preceded by installation of the film and followed by developing and whatever else that I may not know about none of this is the result of human effort, according to them! Some of them explain how this photography is done, and summarize that no less than eleven different actions are involved in the making of a picture. In spite of all this, they say that this picture is not the result of human action! Can it be permissible to hang up a picture of a man, for example, if it is produced by photography, but not if it is drawn by hand? Those who say that photography is permitted have \"frozen\" the meaning of the word \"tasweer,\" restriciting it only to the meaning known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and not adding the meaning of photography, which is \"tasweer\" or \"picture-making\" in every sense - linguistic, legal, and in its harmful effects, and as is clear from the definition mentioned above. Years ago, I said to one of them, By the same token, you could allow idols which have not been carved but have been made by pressing a button on some machine that turns out idols by the dozen. What do you say to that?\" (Aadaab al-Zafaaf by al-Albaani, p. 38) It is also worth quoting the opinion of some contemporary scholars who allow the taking of photographs but say that the pictures should not be kept: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.\" (See al-Sharh al-Mumti', 2/198). There are many bad things involved in the making of pictures. Besides the element of imitating the creation of Allaah - which is an accusation denied by many of those who make pictures - reality bears witness to the great extent of immorality and provocation of desires caused by the prevalence of pictures and picture-making nowadays. We must remove or blot out every picture, except when it is too difficult to do so, like the pictures which are overwhelmingly prevalent in food packaging, or pictures used in encyclopaedias and reference books. We should remove what we can, and be careful about any provocative pictures that may be found. \"So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can\" [al-Taghaabun 64:16 - interpretation of the meaning] Photographs which are essential are permitted - such as those required for identity documents, or for identifying or pursuing criminals [e.g. \"wanted\" posters and the like - translator's note], or for educational purposes which cannot be achieved otherwise. The principle in sharee'ah is that we should not exaggerate about what is necessary. We ask Allaah to accept our repentance and have mercy on us, and to forgive our excesses, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "summary": "we focus on a particular subject: the use of photographs as picture-making devices. This practice is not only illegal in the United States, but also in many other countries around the world. In addition to the obvious evils caused by the widespread use of these devices, there are also the harmful effects that they can have on the Muslim community. For example, one can find statues of Buddha or figures in food packaging. Another prohibition is that any pictures that are hung up must be made by hand.",

        "question": "Some Muslims have exaggerated about breaking their fast to the point that they miss the Magrib prayer; after eating dates comes the soup and juice and so on. What is your advice with regard to such behavior?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.If the meal is put in front of a person without his own intention being to miss the congregational prayer, then he can eat and drink, even if he misses the Maghrib congregational prayer, based on the statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \"If the meal is served and the prayer starts, begin with the meal.\" (Al-Bukhari, 631) As for putting a large portion of food out purposely to miss the congregational prayer, this is the wrong approach and incorrect behavior. Then what is the sunnah? The sunnah is what is reported on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \"that he used to break the fast before he prayed with fresh dates, if there were no fresh dates then with dry dates, and if there were no dry dates, then he sipped from water.\" (At-Tirmidhi and others.

Passing the Black Stone and acknowledging it, after praying two rak\u2019ahs of Tawaaf and drinking from the well of Zamzam and before going out to perform al-Saa\u2019iee is proven to be part of the saheeh Sunnah, but it is mustahabb (encouraged), not waajib (obligatory), so there is nothing wrong with not doing it. The proof (daleel) that it is in accordance with the Sharee\u2019ah is the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), reported by Muslim, in which he described the Hajj of the Prophet : \"... Then he went back to the Rukn (the corner of the Ka\u2019bah where the Black Stone is situated) and acknowledged it, then he went out through the gate towards al-Safaa\u2019.\" Al-Tirmidhi reported from Jaabir that: \"When the Prophet came to Makkah, he entered the Mosque and acknowledged the Black Stone, then he passed to the right of it and ran for three (circuits of Tawaaf) and walked for four. Then he came to al-Maqaam and said: \u2018Take Maqaam Ibraaheem as a place of prayer.\u2019 He prayed two rak\u2019ahs with the Maqaam between him and the House (Ka\u2019bah).\u2019 Then he came to the (Black Stone) after praying two rak\u2019ahs and acknowledged it. Then he went out to Safaa\u2019 and I think he said, \u2018Safaa\u2019 and Marwa are of the Symbols of Allaah [al-Baqarah 2:158].\u2019\" (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 784). Al-Tirmidhi said: The hadeeth of Jaabir is a saheeh hasan hadeeth and the scholars ruled that we should act in accordance with it). Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"This is evidence in favour of the opinion of al-Shaafi\u2019i and other scholars, that after performing Tawaaf al-Qudoom (the Tawaaf of Arrival) and praying behind the Maqaam, a person should go back to the Black Stone and acknowledge it, then go out through the Gate of Safaa to perform al-Saa\u2019iee. The scholars agree that this acknowledgement is not obligatory, but it is Sunnah; the one who does not do it is not obliged to offer a sacrifice in compensation.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The author of Zaad al-Mustanfi said it is permissible for the imaam to greet the congregation with salaam when he faces them. Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen said, in his interesting comment, that this is because this practice was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Even though there is some weakness in this hadeeth (i.e. in its isnaad), this is what the ummah has done and it is well known that when the imaam comes and gets up on the minbar, he greets the people with salaam. (Reported by al-Shubi). Abu Bakr and Umar used to do this. Reported by Abd al-Razzaaq, Ibn Abi Shaybah, 2/114, Ibn Maajah and al-Tabaraani. It was also reported by al-Bayhaqi from Jaabir ibn Umar, narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he said: a report concerning this was narrated from Ibn Abbaas from Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez. Then the shaykh said in his commentary: it is not permitted to speak when the imaam is delivering the khutbah, it is only permitted before and after the khutbah, even after the khateeb has arrived and after the adhaan, so long as the khateeb has not started his khutbah. (Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Sharh al-Muttabi li Zaad al-Mustanfi, 5/78). [?? Makath??] is well known, from which we know that it is obligatory to return the greeting of salaam, so in this case we understand that it is not forbidden to speak. And Allaah knows best. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: When the imaam faces the people, he greets them with salaam and they respond, then he sits down. Then he mentioned the hadeeth quoted above, and others. Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): When he greets them with salaam, the people should respond, because it is more of an obligation to return the greeting than to initiate it. Then he should sit down and rest until the muadhdhinoon (muezzins) finish. (al-Mughni 2/297). And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. He or she is not required to change his or her name unless it embodies the worship of someone or something other then God, Allaah. However, its amelioration by choosing a new Islamic name is legitimate and encouraged. The fact that he or she would change his or her name from a pagan or non-Islamic name to an Islamic one would be considered commendable--however, it is not mandatory. Thus, if one's name is Abdul-Messiah, for example, or similar such names, then he is obligated to change it, as the Prophet (peace upon him) had people with the names Abdul-Ka'bah and Abdul-Uzzah change their names upon accepting Islaam. If the original name does not comprise or imply anything forbidden in Islaam, then he or she is permitted to retain it (such as the name George, for example). As noted, though, it is preferable to change it to an Islaamic name, as this also distinguishes him or her from the kuffaar. Note that if changing one's name in official documents and records poses a great inconvenience, it would suffice to change it among the people. In this case, he or she is called by his or her new name by friends, acquaintances, and the general public, while offical documents would retain the original given name.",

        "question": "A married woman commits adultery, then she repented but the guilt of the act is haunting her. She is now thinking about suicide. What should be done and what is your advice?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The believer sees his sin as a mountain beneath which he is sitting and which he fears may fall down upon him. The rebellious person sees his sin as a fly which passes in front of his nose and he swats it away\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6308) This woman's overwhelming sense of the burden of her sin is a sign of faith. We offer her the following advice: She should examine her divorce from her first husband to make sure that it is sound according to sharee'ah (Islamic law), whether it took the form of talaaq (male-instigated divorce) or khul' (female-instigated divorce). She should make sure that her marriage contract to the second man is also sound, because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery is not valid unless they have repented (see questions # 33); if the contract is found not to be valid, it must be repeated. If this woman is sincere in her repentance towards Allaah, regrets what she did and is determined never to do it again, Allaah will forgive all her sins, no matter how great they were, so she should not despair of the mercy of Allaah, for no one despairs of Allaah's Mercy, except the people who disbelieve, and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are astray? She should hasten to do many good deeds, to expiate for her sin, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And perform al-salaat (the prayer) at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds\" [Hud 11:114] She should resume a pure Islamic life, based on purity and chastity. Suicide is not a solution at all, as it is one of the most grievous of major sins, and will only increase the punishment of the one who does it. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever throws himself down from a high mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down from a mountain in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever takes poison and kills himself will be taking poison in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever kills himself with a weapon (literally, iron) will be holding it in his hand and stabbing himself in the stomach in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5778) We ask Allaah to help this woman to repent sincerely, to forgive her sins and to include her in His Mercy, for He is the All-hearing Who answers prayers.",
        "summary": "This woman is overwhelmed by her sin, and it is a sign that she has faith. She should examine the divorce agreement with her first husband, to make sure it is sound and follows the rules of Islamic law. If the divorce does not sound according to the provisions in Islamic law, then the marriage contract will have to be repeated. Lastly, she should pray fervently for her sin to be removed. The Prophet Salaws said that whoever kills himself will commit suicide at any time during the day, during the night, at the same time as he stabs himself into the stomach during the fire of eternity.",

I REMEMBER A SECTION IN THE Qur'an WHERE THE PROPHET PEACE BE UPON HIM ONCE GAVE A THIRSTY DOG WATER TO DRINK OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE. THANK YOU",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. According to Islaamic Shareeah, it is not permitted to keep a dog except within narrowly-defined limits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: \"Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds will decrease every day by one qeeraat (a unit of measurement), unless it is a dog for farming or herding.\" According to another report: \"... unless it is a dog for herding sheep, farming or hunting.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 2322) Dogs are extremely naajis (impure, unclean). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If a dog drinks from the vessel of any one of you, let him wash it seven times\" (reported by Muslim, no. 279). According to another report: \"... and clean it the eighth time with earth.\" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 280). It is forbidden in Islaam to sell a dog and to receive payment for it, as is reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari from Abu Masoud al-Ansaari: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade (accepting) the price of a dog. (al-Fath, no. 2237) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to resemble dogs by placing our forearms on the ground during sujood (prostration), as in reported in the hadeeth narrated by Anas ibn Maalik, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Do sujood properly; none of you should spread his forearms like a dog does.\" (al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 822). Whoever keeps a dog in his house is denied the blessing of the angels presence in his house, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3225). Keeping dogs nowadays is the habit of the kuffaar, who adopt them as friends, kiss them, let them lick them and their clothes, sleep with them and even leave them money in their wills. Keeping a dog is an imitation of the kuffaar. Some Muslims may claim that they need to keep a dog at home for purposes of protection, to which we respond that nowadays there are burglar alarm systems and other measures one may take for security purposes, and there is no need to keep a dog, praise be to Allaah. It only remains for us to say that the fact that it is forbidden to keep a dog and interect closely with it does not mean that we should not be kind or feel compassion towards dogs if we see them in a pitiful state. These are two entirely separate matters. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that \"a man saw a dog biting the dust because of thirst, so he took his shoe and started to scoop water up with it until the dogs thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and granted him entry to Paradise for it.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 174). According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whilst a man was walking he became very thirsty, so he went down to a well and drank from it. When he came out, he saw a dog panting and biting the soil because of thirst. The man said, He is suffering the same as I suffered, so he filled his shoe (with water), came out and let the dog drink until his thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and forgave him because of it.\" The people asked, \"O Messenger of Allaah, will we be rewarded for how we treat animals?\" He said, \"In every living thing there is a reward.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 2363). We do not want to omit reminding you of the importance of reading the Quraan properly and referring to it. You say in your question that the story of the thirsty dog is in the Quraan, and that is not the case, as it is reported in the Sunnah. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "The dog is a dangerous and unaccomplished creature. It is also not permitted to sell or receive payment for a dog, unless it is used for farming or sheep-herding or hunting. Similarly, if a person keeps a dog he will lose all his good deeds every day because of it. The same can be said for any other dog. Dogs are \"extremely naajis,\" unclean. According to the Hadeeth narration by Anas al-Maalik, keeping a dog is considered an imitation of kuffaars, who adopt animals as friends, kisses them, pet them, and even leaves them money in wills.",

Finally would I have to change my name?",

I was besieged with great joy as I discovered your question while browsing through the ten questions which arrived during the past hour today, and it was the dearest question for me. This fact is not surprising, as how could our hearts not open to a wise man who has discovered the truth and has acknowledged and confirmed it for himself--one who wishes to embrace Islaam and asks about the next steps? In reality, everything that poses a problem for you is actually an easy matter, and can be solved simply, God willing (in shaa' Allaah), so let's take them one by one: First: all that is required of you to embrace this religion right now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce al-shahaadatain, or the two confirmations and attestations of faith, to the best of your ability. Perfect pronunciation of the Arabic letters is not required, and the following is a transliteration of the phrases with English letters to help you: ash-hadu an laa ilaahah illallaah (I bear witness and attest that there is no god worthy of worship but the One God Allaah) ash-hadu anna muhammad-ar-rasool ullaah (I bear witness and attest that Muhammad is the messenger of Allaah) After pronouncing them, you should promptly hasten to take a shower to purify yourself and prepare to start performing your regular prayers which will be an obligation as soon as you have declared your belief. Second: If you have not yet learned the manner and characteristics of performing the prayer (i.e. at least the movements and positions), appended to this message is a description from which you can learn. What is requried from you for the time being is to say in the beginning of the prayer and between each movement between positions \"Allaahu ak-bar\" (a glorification of Allaah). While standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting, you should say \"subhaan allaah wal-hamdu lillaah wa-laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar.\" (Glory be to Allaah, and praise and thanks be to Allaah, and there is no god but Allaah, and Allaah is the most Exalted and Great.) Then conclude the prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying \"as-salaamu alaikum.\" This way of performing salaat is permissible for you until you can learn and memorize what should be said in each movement and position of the salaat. Third: You are not required to change your name, and in fact, a number of scholars among the forefathers and modern-day Muslims have indicated declared that your name is in fact the name of one of the prophets! I ask Allaah to aid you and ease your affairs, and to bestow upon you the blessing of Islaam and perseverence in adhering to it. We are ready and willing to assist in explaining or helping to solve any problem or difficulty you may face, and to provide support and aid in any way possible.",
        "summary": "This is a very warm letter from Dr. Manette, who explains that the ten questions he has been working on answering have all been answered by the wise man himself. He says that everything that initially seemed like a big problem for him was actually an easy solution, God willing.

The wise man answers all ten questions correctly, and then goes on to explain that everyone can be cured of their problems as soon as they are resolved. For example, if you haven't yet learned how to recite al-shahadain or two confirmations of faith in order to begin performing regular prayers, you should immediately take a shower, get dressed, and start performing daily prayers. If you don't yet know how to perform these rituals, you can learn how to do them at the time by memorizing Arabic letters. After performing his prayers, he should prepare to take a good shower, purify himself, and prepare to go to bed.",

Allah has blessed me with guidance and brought me to His straight path again. Since that time, I have been having a relationship with a christian girlfriend, who has accepted Islam just recently, by Allah's will. We plan to be wedded soon after we are settled. One problem is that she comes from a devout Christian family, not to mention her father being a christian priest. Ever since her family found out about our involvement, they have tried almost everything to part us, we haven't told them about my girlfriend's conversion though. Right now, our relationship has reached a point where she is willing to oppose her family and runaway from them eventually. Even though we know it will be hard to go through, my girlfriend and I really love each other.

And second, if it can, who can be her \"wali?\", since not one of her family member agree with our relationship. Thank you, assalaammu'alaikum.",

If there is a Muslim with some authority in your area over the affairs of the Muslim community, then he can act in this capacity, based on the Prophet's (peace be upon him) hadeeth: \"No marriage contract can be concluded without the presence of a Wali. A Sultan (authority figure) can act as a Wali for those without one.\" (see Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad, Hadith number 1880; also in Salih al-Jaami', hadeeth number 7556.)

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.A brief summary of the requirements for the Ghusl follow. First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs. Allah knows best.",

        "question": "I would like to know more about female circumcision in Islam. I have read the ahadith where the Prophet told a woman how to perform it. I would like to know if it is optional or obligatory, and - if it is obligatory - whether there is a certain way to do it (what part should be cut?).",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his book al-Mughni: \"Circumcision is obligatory for men, and it is an honour for women, but it is not obligatory for them. This is the opinion of many scholars. (Imam) Ahmad said: For men it is more strictly required, but for women it is less strictly required.\" (al-Mughni 1/70). Circumcision of the female consists of the removal of a part of the clitoris, which is situated above the opening of the urethra. The Sunnah is not to remove all of it, but only a part. (al-Mawsu\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah 19/28). In this matter, it is wise to follow the interests of the female: if the clitoris is large, then part of it should be removed, otherwise it should be left alone. This size of the clitoris will vary from woman to woman, and there may be differences between those from hot climates and those from cold climates. A hadith on the topic of female circumcision has been attributed to the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him), according to which he said: \"Circumcision is a Sunnah for men, and an honour for women,\" but there is some debate as to the authenticity of this hadith. See Silsilah al-Ahadith al-Da\u2018ifah by al-Albani, no. 1935. How circumcision is to be performed is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Umm \u2018Atiyah, may Allah be pleased with her, according to which a woman used to perform circumcisions in Madinah. The Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) told her: \"Do not abuse (i.e. do not go to extremes in circumcising); that is better for the woman and more liked by her husband.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Adab; he said this hadith is da\u2018if). The scholars\u2019 opinions cited above should be sufficient explanation. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Preventing female circumcision is obligatory for both men and women, but not obligatory for women.

The scholars' opinions on the subject of female circumcision are cited above; however, Umm Atiyah does not support the claim that all female circumcisions must be done in strict fashion.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. A Muslim is not permitted to inherit anything of the wealth of a non-Muslim relative, as the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The believer does not inherit from a kaafir (disbeliever) and the kaafir does not inherit from a believer.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath 4283). According to another report, he said: \"The Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim.\" (al-Bukhaari, 6764). The Messenger of Allah (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: \"People who belong to two different religions do not inherit from one another.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Faraa\u2019id, and deemed hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2018, 7614) - because when the ties of religion are cut, the ties of inheritance are also cut, because the former is the basis of the latter. However, if a non-believer makes a will leaving one-third or less of his wealth to his child (son or daughter), one is entitled to take it, because this is a will as opposed to inheritance according to a non-Islamic system. This difference is well-known in Islamic fiqh. And Allah knows best.",

        "question": "What do Muslims believe happens in the hereafter to Non-Muslims that believe in one God?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Your interest in studying Islam is something great, which we appreciate. Everyone should seek the truth wherever it may be, and follow it even if it differs from the way of their forefathers or the religion of the country or society in which they live, because salvation from the Fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement is more important than anything else. One of the most important things that the would-be student of Islam should do is to consult authentic Islamic references, in order to understand the reality of this religion. For example, one should consult translations of the meanings of the Qur\u2019an and the ahaadeeth (sayings) of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace be upon him), ensuring that the translations are sound. But reading books written by non-Muslims, or by Muslims who do not really understand or practice their religion, is not a scholarly approach or a sound method of finding out the truth. Returning to your question, what do Muslims believe will happen to atheists? Or for that matter, what about monotheists who are not Muslim? Will their fate be Hell in the Hereafter? The answer is that Allaah has clearly created everything, sent His blessings on His creation, and sent Messengers and Revealed Books to tell them that whoever believes in and worships Him alone, not associating any partner with Him, will enter Paradise, and whoever denies Him, or worships something else besides Him, or takes other gods instead of Him, or says that He has a wife or son, or that the angels are His daughters, or follows a law other than that which He revealed to judge between people in truth, or turns away from His religion, will be doomed in the Hereafter to the eternal punishment of Hell. This is exact justice, and this will be the fate deserved by the one who did not give his Creator His due. Worshipping Allaah, obeying His commands and adhering to His prohibitions are basic matters, but they form the essence of the relationship between the Creator and His creation. Allah says: \"And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and men except they should worship Me (alone).\" [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56] Messengers were sent with one message: to tell their people \"Worship Allaah, for you have no god besides Him.\" Hence we may understand just how far short the person falls who believes that Allaah is one and does not associate anything with Him, but does not worship or obey Him, but rebels against Him and fails to follow His religion or Law, or the Revelation and Messengers which He sent for him and people like him. Does such a person deserve to enter Paradise or Hell? This is the person who says: \"I believe that there is One God Who created the universe, but I am going to stop there; I will not pray to Him or fast or perform Hajj or pay zakaat as He commanded. I am not going to carry out any duties towards Him; I will follow my own desires and do whatever I want, whether He permitted it or forbade it.\" Can such a person attain salvation on the Day of Judgement? Allaah sent Messengers to every nation, that they might worship Him and shun false deities. The last nation is this ummah, and the last Messenger is Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allaah sent him for the whole of mankind, the entire world, and thus abrogated the previous laws and made this religion the best and most perfect and complete. Hence it is obligatory for everyone to enter this religion, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:85] On this basis, the fate of one who says \"I believe in the idea of One God, but I do not want to be a Muslim, or I do not want to follow the last Revelation or the last Prophet,\" is clear. Furthermore, the fate of an atheist, who rejects even the belief in God, is even clearer and more evident. Finally, I hope that the matter is now clearer to you. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and help us to follow it, for He is the best Supporter and Helper.",

He fears that if he remains as imaam of the mosque, he may become a hypocrite or show off. Should he stay in the mosque? Should he continue leading the people in prayer, or should he leave this position out of fear of becoming a hypocrite and show off?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.You describe this young man as being loved by his people, but he is guilty of some transgression which is a matter between him and his Lord. I say that the fact that Allaah has blessed him with the position of imaam and the love of his people dictates that he should give up his sin and stop transgressing against himself, and he should worship Allaah properly, and give thanks to Allaah, because the fact that a person is loved by his people and is their imaam is a great blessing from Allaah.

It is well known that women are by nature jealous and reluctant to share their husband with other women. Women are not to be condemned for this jealousy, for it existed in thebest of righteous women, the Sahaabiyyaat, and even in the Mothers of the Believers [the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)]. But women should not let jealousy make them object to that which Allaah has prescribed, and they should not try to prevent it; a wife should allow her husband to marry another woman for this is a kind of cooperating in righteousness and piety. According to a hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever pays attention to his brother\u2019s needs, Allaah will pay attention to his needs.\u201d The first wife\u2019s consent is not a prerequisite for a man to take another wife. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about this and replied as follows: \u201cIt is not obligatory for the husband, if he wants to take a second wife, to have the consent of his first wife, but it is good manners and kindness to deal with her in such a manner that will reduce the hurt which women naturally feel in such situations. This is done by being kind to her and speaking to her in a gentle and pleasant manner, and by spending whatever money may be necessary in order to gain her acceptance of the situation.\u201d Concerning her request for divorce if her husband wants to marry another wife, this is a mistake. But they should examine the situation, and if she really cannot cope with living with another wife, then she can ask him for khula\u2019 [ a kind of divorce instigated by the wife, whereby she forgoes the mahr]. If she can cope with living with the second wife, but it hurts her to do so, then she should be patient and seek the pleasure of Allaah. Thawbaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cNo woman asks her husband for a divorce for no reason, but the fragrance of Paradise is forbidden for her.\u201d (Narrated by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, may Allaah have mercy on him). If she bears it with patience, then Allaah will make it easier for her and will expand her chest (i.e., grant her peace and calm), and will compensate her with something good. The husband must also help her by treating her kindly, being patient with her for any jealousy etc. on her part, and overlooking her mistakes. And Allaah is the source of help.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. If a man can marry a first wife physically and financially and treat both wives according to the Prophet, then he can do so. However, if a man wants to marry multiple wives, he must first obtain the consent of the first wife before he can marry another woman. A wife should be kind to her husband and spend whatever money she needs to get him to comply with the wishes of his second wife. When a woman asks for divorce, she should ask her husband for khula [a kind of divorce]. If she really can't cope living with living with two wives, then perhaps she can ask her ex-wife for a divorce. But if she really cant cope with living without the second wife because she doesn't want to go through with it, then she could ask her former husband for a khula.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the dear inquirer: We appreciate the question you have submitted, as it is an issue which is truly among those which may pose a hindrance in some cases for those who wish to adopt Islaam. In reality the issue is really simpler than many may think. Male circumcision is among the rites of Islaam and is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character and instinct of the human creation, and is from the religion of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then we revealed to you (the command) to follow the pure and uncorrupted religion of Ibrahim.\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) was circumcisized when he was eighty years old.\" (Al-Bukhari, Vol 6/p. 388, Al-Salfiyya printing). Male circumcision is obligatory for the Muslim male if he is able to do it. If, however, he is unable, whether due to fear of injury or if a respected and authoritative doctor has told him he will experience profuse bleeding which may make his life miserable, then the obligation for cirumcision is waived and he does not commit a sin by not having it done. It is not permissible under any circumstance for the issue to become a hindrance for a person wanting to accept Islaam. The validity of one's acceptance of Islaam is not dependent on his performance of circumcision and it is valid for one to adopt Islaam even if he has not had himself circumcized. Regarding the issue of female circumcision, please refer to question # 328. I ask Allaah to bring you success in all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "summary": "In reality, the issue of male circumcision is really simple: Male circumcision is mandatory for Muslim men if they are capable of doing it. If not, then there's no reason why he should not be circumcised. It's part of the \"fitrah\" or the natural character and instincts of the human being, which makes him a good candidate for Islaam because he doesn't commit any sin by not getting circumcised. The same goes for female circumcisions. In reality, as long as the Muslim male can do it, then everything is fine. You don't have to get circumcised unless you're an old man who has been around eighty years old. There's nothing wrong with having a good time, though.",

        "question": "Is zakat due on Mutual Funds investments that are in a RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) account? If yes, then is it due on the total value or only on that portion which will be available after Income Tax has been deducted at source? (RRSP is the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. 401K Plan. Under this scheme, one can save money towards future retirement income and defer current Income Tax on the portion of the income that is being saved in the plan. The deferred income tax is later deducted at source when the funds are eventually withdrawn from the plan; however, since the withdrawals are usually done after retirement (when there is no other significant source of income), one ends up being taxed at a substantially lower tax rate. Naturally, withdrawal prior to retirement will incur higher tax rates.)",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. If a person receives an amount of money that he could not have received before, like a bonus or lump sum paid at the end of a period of work, or on retirement, no zakat is due for the time that has passed. Zakat must be paid on whatever is left of that money after an entire Hijri year has passed. If tax or anything else is deducted, then zakat is due only on the amount which the person receives, and after one year has passed. And Allah knows best.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The basic reason for keeping the Ka`bah on one\u2019s left when performing tawaf (circumambulation) is to follow the suit of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Following the Prophet has been ordained in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): \"Obey the Prophet so that you may be blessed with mercy\" and \"Say (O Muhammad): if you really love Allah, then follow my suit and Allah will love you and grant you forgiveness of your sins\". The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), furthermore, has said regarding the rituals of Hajj and `Umrah, \"Follow my suit in performing your rituals\". (See An-Nasai as reported by Jabir. Also, Sahih al-Jami`, hadith No. 7882) This should suffice as the reason for a Muslim to perform tawaf around the Ka`bah in the way it is done, and we do not need other reasons that attempt to tie this act to the movement of galaxies and stars or the revolving of planets, etc. Muslims by nature must believe, submit to and act according to what was validly and duly recorded as the behavior or statements of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If on top of this a reason or some relevant wisdom comes to be known, then so be it, thanks to Allah. Otherwise, a Muslim submits to the order of Allah and His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and will accordingly be recompensed for his compliance and deeds. Finally, we must note that circumambulation is an act specified only for the Ka`bah as part of the worship and is not to be done in other places or situations as such. Allah is the Most Knowledgeable and knows best.",
        "summary": "Preventing circumambulationThe basic reason why keeping the Ka'bah on one's left when performing tuafs is to obey the \"adulterated behavior\" of the Prophet and, therefore, to follow his suit.

As part of the prayer to Allaah using His names, we call on him by saying, O Merciful, have mercy on me; O Forgiver, forgive my sins; O Provider, provide for me, etc. However, to read a specific verse a certain number of times (whether 99 times or whatever else) without any valid documented evidence is a bidaah (an unacceptable act of innovation in religious practices) that is not permissible.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever innovates in our religion a new act (of worship) then his act is rejected\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Fath al-Baari No. 2697.) The best guidance is that of the Prophet. There is no allowance for innovation in the religion of Allaah. Is it possible for us to discover new things in our religion that the Prophet didnt know? Indeed, it is incumbent upon us to read the Koran in the way the Prophet read it, we need to pray in the way he prayed, and glorify Allaahs name in the way the Prophet has been validly reported to have done.

In other words, anyone who does not know how to worship Allaah will be judged because he or she did not follow the Prophet's guidance. It is up to the reader to interpret the text according to what the Prophet says and not to repeat certain verses a certain amount of time without valid documented evidence.

Through it, man can help in the development and civilization of this earth, and through it man can ponder the signs of Allaah's creation. Accordingly, Muslims have concentrated on the study of this universe and made great strides in the fields of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, physics, etc. However, the specifics of these contributions are not the area of concentration for Muslim scholars, and there are perhaps better sources than this forum to explain the role of Muslim scientists, such as books written for this specific purpose.

However, if there is a situation in the marital life taking place between the man and the woman, due to a defect or defects in one or both of them, such as problems of Din, bad character, sickness, or a defect such as being sterile or similar, then out of the mercy of Allah, seeking divorce is permissible. In this case, it is okay and there is nothing prohibited in seeking a divorce. Seeking divorce for no reason The thing which is prohibited is a wife seeking a divorce from her husband for no (valid) reason in the Shari\u2019ah. There is a serious promise made for seeking a divorce without a valid reason.

Seeking divorce without avalid reason The thing that is prohibited -- a wife seeking divorce from her spouse for no legitimate reason -- is permitted. However, there is still a promise made for divorcing a woman for a serious reason. For example, she may seek a divorce without telling her husband that she has ulterior motives.

A Muslim never refers to him simply as `Jesus', but always adds the phrase \"peace be upon him.\" Creation of Jesus The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled `Mary') in her time, and Mary is considered the purest woman in all creation. The Quran describes the creation of Jesus as follows (interpretation of the meaning): \"Behold! the Angel said, `God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and the Hereafter, and one that shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' She said: `O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: `Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He but says to it, \"Be!\" and it is.\" (Al Imran 3:42-7) Jesus (peace be upon him) was born miraculously through the same power which had brought Adam (peace be upon him) into being without a father: \"Truly, the likeness of Jesus unto Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, `Be!' and he was.\" (Al Imran 3:59) Miracles of Jesus During his prophetic mission, Jesus (peace be upon him) was granted and performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said (interpretation of meaning): \"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allah\u2019s leave. And I heal the blind and the lepers, and I raise the dead by Allah\u2019s leave.\" (Al Imran 3:49) Other miracles include speaking soon after birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, and, most importantly, the message he was carrying. Was Jesus crucified? These miracles were granted to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified, but it only appeared so; instead, Allah raised him unto Heaven. (An-Nisa 4:157) Neither Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), nor Jesus (peace be upon him), came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God, brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Quran Jesus (peace be upon him), is reported as saying that he came: \"To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me.\" (al Imran 3:50) And Allah knows best.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Just as illicit sexual relations can occur between men, they can also occur between women. The Muslim fuqahaa call this sihaaq (lesbianism), which they define as sexual relations between one woman and another (al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah by Zaydaan, 5/450), and state that it is a punishable offence (the punishment is a form of discipline for disobedience; no specific punishment is given in the Quraan, so the punishment is to be set by the Qaadi according to the circumstances of the crime and the one who commits it). The lesbians testimony is unacceptable because she is a evildoer (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/253). Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"If two women masturbate one another, then they are cursed fornicators\" (al-Mughni 10/162). Some of the scholars, like al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam say that a lesbian is not permitted to look at a Muslim woman, and that a Muslim woman is not permitted to uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of a lesbian, because she is an evildoer who cannot be trusted not to describe her to others. If what is described above is the nature of the relationship between the two women mentioned in the question, then they must repent sincerely to Allaah and stop their evil actions. If their being together in one place will lead to them committing this sin, then they must never meet, so as to avoid this wrongful act. Their husbands desertion of them may be one of the reasons for them falling into this kind of perversion, because they have no legitimate way in which to fulfil their desires and so they have resorted to this haraam way. So they must think seriously of finding Muslim husbands with whom they can live in the way prescribed by Islaam. As for love, this is a different kind of sin, which need not necessarily be associated with physical desire. It is dangerous because it leads to the lover worshipping the beloved, so that he thinks only of the one he loves, cannot bear to be parted from him by day and dreams about him at night; he lives and dies for his sake, and may change when he sees him and become sick when he is absent. This kind of relationship destroys a persons mental health and destroys his relationship with his Lord, because it makes the lover worship his beloved and it is haraam to worship anything other than Allaah. The solution to this disastrous situation is total separation, so that one will never see that person, or hear news of him again.",
        "summary": "we delve deeper into the topic of sexual relations between men and women. Again, it's important to note that these are not just sexual relations; they can also involve relationships between one person and another. For example, if a woman masturbates with a Muslim man, then she's committing adultery. The same goes for love. If you're thinking about \"indirect sexual relations\" between a man and a woman, well, let's stick with abstinence for a minute. In other words, sex is a sin, but it doesn't necessarily have to do with physical desire--it just has to be done in the right way.",

        "question": "Why do we have to follow the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad and not just follow the quraan? Why do we have to follow a specific Mathab?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The first question may appear strange and somewhat surprising to committed, practising Muslims. How can something which is so obviously one of the bases of Islaam become a matter for discussion and debate? But since the question has been asked, we will present, with the help of Allaah, the principles and bases of the importance of the Sunnah, the obligation to follow it and the ruling concerning those who reject it. By so doing, we will also refute the doubters and the misguided group who call themselves \u201cQur\u2019aaniyyeen\u201d (the Qur\u2019aan has nothing to do with them!) In sha Allaah this discussion will be of benefit to everyone who wants to understand the truth of the matter. Proof of the importance of the Sunnah (1) The Qur\u2019aan speaks of the importance of the Sunnah, for example: (a) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cHe who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allaah...\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:80] Allaah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): \u201cO you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger...\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:59] (b) Allaah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... And let those who oppose the Messenger\u2019s commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.\u201d [al-Nur 24:63] (c) Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: \u201c\u201dBut no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:65] (d) Allaah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: \u201cO you who believe! Answer Allaah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life...\u201d [al-Anfaal 8:24] (e) Allaah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: \u201c... (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger...\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:59] (2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example: (a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi\u2019 and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u201cI do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying \u2018I don\u2019t accept it; we didn\u2019t find any such thing in the Book of Allaah.\u2019\u201d Abu \u2018Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663). Al-\u2019Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u201cWould any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allaah would only describe what is forbidden in the Qur\u2019aan? I tell you, by Allaah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Qur\u2019aan, if not more so.\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wa\u2019l-imaarah wa\u2019l-fay\u2019). (b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-\u2019Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, that \u201cthe Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly... (he said), \u2018Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it.\u2019\u201d (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah). (3) The scholars\u2019 consensus (ijmaa\u2019) affirming the importance of the Sunnah. Al-Shaafi\u2019i, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \u201cI do not know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabi\u2019een who narrated a report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabi\u2019een, and those whom we met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be considered as one of the ignorant. (4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition to what is in the Qur\u2019aan. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and the Qur\u2019aan when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions. The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of the religion. As regards your second question, about whether a Muslim is required to follow a particular madhhab, the answer is that he does not have to. For the average \u201crank and file\u201d Muslim, his madhhab is that of his mufti or the scholar whom he consults for religious verdicts; he must ask those pious scholars whom he trusts for opinions when necessary. If a person has enough knowledge to distinguish which evidence and opinion is stronger, then he must follow the scholarly opinion which has the strongest support from the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah. It is acceptable for a Muslim to follow one of the four well-known madhhabs, on the condition that he understands that the truth in any given issue may lie with another madhhab, in which case he must ignore his own madhhab\u2019s opinion and follow the truth. The Muslim\u2019s aim is to follow the truth that is in accordance with the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah. The madhhabs of fiqh are only a means of reaching ahkaam (rules) based on the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, they are not Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah. We ask Allaah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood and help us to avoid it. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "summary": "The first question that comes to mind is, how on earth can something so obviously important as the Sunnah become a subject for debate and debate? Well, according to the Free Thought Movement, it does. They argue that the central principle of the religion is the obligation to obey it. In other words, obedience to the prophet means obeying him and obeying his commandment. If you're not obeying the prophet, then you're a kaafir because you don't have any faith. Common sense indicates importance of the sunnah. The same goes for those who are opposed to the doctrine of the suttee: they will be condemned to eternal hell. As regards the second question, what should a Muslim follow? The answer is simple: \"I do not have to follow a madhhab.\" It's just a means to reach ahkaam/rules based on the holy ad-hwaam.",

        "question": "Why does the Quran use the term \"We\" when referring to Allah in its verses? Many non-believers believe that this may be in reference to Jesus?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu, \u2018We\u2019, for respect or glorification. He may also use the word ana, \u2018I\u2019, indicating one person, or the third person huwa, \u2018He\u2019. All three styles are used in the Quran, where Allah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 4/143) \u201cAllah, may He be glorified and exalted, sometimes refers to Himself in the singular, by name or by use of a pronoun, and sometimes by use of the plural, as in the phrase (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018Verily, We have given you a manifest victory\u201d [Al-Fath 48:1], and other similar phrases. But Allah never refers to Himself by use of the dual, because the plural refers to the respect that He deserves, and may refer to His names and attributes, whereas the dual refers to a specific number (and nothing else), and He is far above that.\u201d (Al-\u2018Aqidah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 75) These words, inna (\u201cVerily We\u201d) and nahnu (\u201cWe\u201d), and other forms of the plural, may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which they say \u201cWe have decided...\u201d etc. [This is known in English as \u201cThe Royal We\u201d \u2013 Translator]. In such cases, only one person is speaking but the plural is used for respect. The One Who is more deserving of respect than any other is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so when He says in the Quran inna (\u201cVerily We\u201d) and nahnu (\u201cWe\u201d), it is for respect and glorification, not to indicate plurality of numbers. If a verse of this type is causing confusion, it is essential to refer to the clear, unambiguous verses for clarification. If a Christian, for example, insists on taking verses such as \u201cVerily, We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning] as proof of divine plurality, we may refute this claim by quoting such clear and unambiguous verses as (interpretation of the meanings): \u201cAnd your god is One God, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:163] and \u201cSay: He is Allah, the One\u201d [al-Ikhlas 112:1] \u2013 and other verses which can only be interpreted in one way. Thus confusion will be dispelled for the one who is seeking the truth. Every time Allah uses the plural to refer to Himself, it is based on the respect and honour that He deserves, and on the great number of His names and attributes, and on the great number of His troops and angels.\u201d (See Al-\u2018Aqidah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 109) And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Inna, nahnu or verse inna, or \"verily we,\" may be used as a way to refer to Allah. Inna means \"we\" or \"the one who is deserving of respect more deserving than any other; so when he says in Quran inna/v verily We,\" it is not to indicate majority of numbers. It is instead meant to indicate plural numbers. The author should also note that the plural refers only to those who have achieved victory, whereas the singular refers to anything else.

It repeatedly mentions beautiful, pure maidens as a bounty of Heaven. People often say Islam is a male dominance religion. Why is there no mention of rewards for women?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All address to men in the Quran is address to women Since you believe in Allah and His Book, you must know that {and not one will thy Lord treat with injustice}, Verse 49, Surat al-Kahf, or the Cave, and {Allah is never unjust in the least degree: if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from His Own Self a great reward}, Verse 40, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women. (Translation of the meanings) Allah has meant this Law of Islam (Shari'ah) for both men and women. All address to men in the Quran is address to women as well, and all rules affecting men affect women as well unless evidence is established that one of them is meant and not the other as in the rules relating to Jihad (fighting for Islam), menstruation, custodianship, rule etc. The evidence that women are included in Verses of the Quran in the male gender is a Hadith by \u2018Aishah who said that the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about a man who sees traces of semen but does not remember having any dream of a sexual nature. The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Such a man should perform the Ghusl (ritual bath).\u201d He was also asked of a man who remembers a dream of a sexual nature but sees no traces of semen. He said: \"Such a man does not have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath). Umm Salim said \"A woman may have the same experience. Does she have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath)?\" The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Yes, there is no difference in this between man and woman.\" (Narrated by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi 113 and others. The last phrase is in Sahih al-Jami\u2019 under No. 2333) What will women get in Jannah? With respect to rewards in the Hereafter and what women have in Heaven, we include a number of Verses and Hadiths as follows: Umm Salamah said: \"O Messenger of Allah. I did not hear a Verse in the Quran regarding the Hijrah (migration with the Prophet) of women.\" Then was revealed the Verse: {And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: ye are members, one of another: those who have left their homes, and were driven out therefrom, and suffered harm in My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I will blot out from them their inequities, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath;... A reward from Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards.}, Verse 195, Surat al-Imran, or the Family (translation of the meaning). The Hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3023. Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse {fastajaba lahum rabbuhum} means Allah replied to their queries... and the Verse {anni la udi\u2019u \u2018amala \u2018amilin minkum min thakarin aw untha} is an explanation of the reply meaning that good deeds will not be lost or ignored. All men and women will have the just reward for their deeds. The Verse {ba\u2019dukum min ba\u2019d} means you will be treated equally with respect to rewards. {If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.}, Verse 124, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women (translation of the meaning). In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse shows Allah\u2019s kindness, generosity and mercy in accepting the good deeds of all people, men and women, provided that they believe, in allowing them into Heaven and in not decreasing rewards for their good deeds, not even in the least. {Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has faith, verily, to him will we give a life that is good and pure, and we will bestow on such their reward according to the best of actions.}, Verse 97, Surat an-Nahl, or the Bees (translation of the meaning). Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said this is a promise by Allah, the Exalted, to those who do good deeds i.e. deeds acceptable to Allah in which a Muslim follows the rules set in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him), be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and will be rewarded in the Hereafter. A good life would include all types of comfort. {He that makes evil will not be requited but by the like thereof; and he that makes a righteous deed whether man or woman and is a believer, such will enter the garden (of bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure.}, Verse 40, Surat al-Muminun, or the believers (translation of the meaning). Finally; Dear Sister, here is a Hadith that will dispel any doubt you may have with respect to the mentioning of women: Umm Umarah al-Ansariyyah said that she went to the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) and said to Him: \"I feel that everything is for men. Women are not mentioned as having anything. Then was revealed the Verse (translation of the meaning): {For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women etc}, Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates. The Hadith is narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3211, and is in Sahih at-Tirmidhi under No. 2565. In the collection of Hadiths of Imam Ahmad was narrated the Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"I said \"O Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) of Allah. Why aren\u2019t we mentioned in the Quran in an equal footing with men?\" Then; I was surprised to hear Him call one day from the pulpit: \"O people.\" As I was combing my hair at the moment, I wrapped it up and came close to the door and stood there listening to him say: \"Allah, Mighty and Sublime be He, revealed that (in meaning) {For Muslim men and women; for believing men and women; for devout men and women, for true men and women; for men and women who are patient and constant; for men and women who humble themselves; for men and women who give in charity; for men and women who fast; for men and women who guard their chastity; and for men and women who engage much in Allah's remembrance, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.} Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Remember how Allaah has blessed you by bringing you back to Islam after you have been neglecting salaah, and keep on doing the prayers at the right times. Do more naafil (supererogatory or extra) prayers to make up for the fard (obligatory) prayers that you have missed, as was advised in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Hurayth ibn Qubaysah, who said: I came to Madeenah and prayed, O Allaah, send me a righteous companion. I went and sat with Abu Hurayrah and said: I asked Allaah to bless me with a righteous companion; tell me a hadeeth that you heard from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that I may benefit therefrom. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound, he will be successful, and if it is lacking in any way, he will be doomed. If his obligatory prayers are lacking, the Lord will say: Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary prayers which may be used to make up what is lacking in his obligatory prayers. Then all his deeds will be examined and dealt with in the same way. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 413; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 2020). Abu Dawood reported from Anas ibn Hakeem al-Dabbi that he came to Madeenah and met Abu Hurayrah. He said: He asked me about my lineage so I told him about it, then he said: O young man, shall I not tell you a hadeeth? I said, Of course, may Allaah have mercy on you, and I think he mentioned it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: The first thing that people will be asked about on the Day of Resurrection will be their prayers. Our Lord will say to His angels (although He knows best): Look at My slaves prayers: are they complete or is something lacking? If they are complete, they will be recorded as such, but if something is lacking, He will say: Look and see if My slave has any voluntary prayers to his credit. If this proves to be the case, He will say: Make up his (missing) obligatory prayers with his voluntary prayers. Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same manner. (Saheeh al-Jaami, 2571)",

It is also the greatest day of Hajj, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) told us. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, see Saheeh al-Jaami\u2018, 8191). The reason why it is described as the greatest day of the year is that it combines so many acts of worship which are not combined on any other day, such as the Eid prayer, offering the sacrifice, reciting Takbeer (glorifying Allaah), and widespread remembrance of Allaah. For the pilgrims in Makkah, it also includes offering a sacrifice, stoning the pillars representing Shaytaan (the devil), shaving the head (for men only; women merely cut a little off their hair), and performing Tawaaf (circumambulation of the Ka\u2018bah) and Sa\u2018ee (running between the two hills of Safaa and Marwa).",

What is the ruling on this action?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This action is haraam. It is not permissible for a person to claim to belong to anyone other than his father, because this leads to further lies, and has an impact on matters of inheritance, who is considered to be a mahram, and all other issues that have to do with lineage. Thus the texts issue stern warnings to those who claim to belong to anyone other than their fathers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever claims to belong to anyone other than his father on him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all the people. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104). This action is also a major sin comprised of two major sins, lying in order to consume wealth unlawfully and claiming to belong to someone other than one's father. This person has to go back to what is true, and give up the nationality he aquired improperly. He should go back to using his proper documents that prove his real lineage. This is obligatory upon him. I am astounded that anyone would do such a thing for worldly gains. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whome We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (- far away from Allaahs Mercy). [al-Isra 17:18] The one who does this had to repent to Allaah, and Allaah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95 interpretation of the meaning]. With regard to whatever money he has taken as a result of having that nationality, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba [usury] shall not be punished for the past [al-Baqarah 2:275].

Some of the salaf used to do this, using vessels such as plates and the like. If someone does this, he has a precedent in the salaf or early generations of Islam.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Wearing gold is haraam for men. \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a gold ring on a man\u2019s hand. He took it off and threw it aside, saying, \"Would any of you take a burning coal and hold it in his hand?\" When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had gone away, someone said to the man, \"Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e., sell it).\" He said, \"No, by Allaah, I will not take it after the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has thrown it away.\" (reported by Muslim, no. 2090). \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al\u2019Aas reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever of my ummah wears gold and dies wearing it, Allaah will deny him the gold of Paradise. Whoever of my ummah wears silk and dies wearing it, Allaah will deny him the silk of Paradise.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad). This prohibition applies to men only, not to women, as \u2018Ali, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, and said: \"These are forbidden for the males of my ummah.\" (reported by al-Nisaa\u2019i and Abu Dawud). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: \"Wearing silk and gold is permitted for the women of my ummah and prohibited for the males.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad) Gold is permitted for women because of their delicate and gentle nature, and their need for adornment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"(Do they then like for Allaah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing gold and silk ornaments, i.e., women), and in dispute cannot make herself clear?\" [al-Zukhruf 43:18] As for men, it is a sign of instability and an unmasculine nature to adorn oneself with gold. Islaam wants the differences between the sexes to be marked clearly, and their distinct characteristics to stand out, because when they resemble one another, much corruption results therefrom. The prohibition of gold for men includes pure gold, gold alloys, cut pieces, joined pieces, gold inlay, etc. As for gold-plating and gilding, some scholars are of the opinion that such articles are forbidden for men if it is possible to extract gold from them (by peeling or shaving off, for example); if no gold can be extracted from it, then such items are permitted. Some scholars say that it is not permitted to wear an item which is wholly or mostly gold-plated, but if only a little part of it is gold-plated (like the hands of a watch, or the numerals, or the tiny points denoting numbers), then it is permitted to wear it. They say that the issue is its appearance, not its value: if the gold-plating is very obvious and covers everything, it is not permitted, because many people will not make the distinction between gold-plate and real gold, and some may follow this person\u2019s example and begin to wear pure gold. And Allaah knows best.",

If you're wondering what the heck this is all about, it's none of our business. It's all about making sure that no one else has a problem with it.

For this reason Islam has a great deal to say about this bad characteristic, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described cures for this \"disease\" and ways to limit its effects, among which are the following: Seeking refuge with Allah from the Shaytan Sulayman ibn Sard said: \"I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and two men were slandering one another. One of them was red in the face, and the veins on his neck were standing out. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \u2018I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he feels would go away. If he said \"I seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan,\" what he feels (i.e., his anger) would go away.\u2019\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 6/337) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If a man gets angry and says, \u2018I seek refuge with Allah,\u2019 his anger will go away.\" (Sahih al-Jami\u2019 al-Saghir, no. 695) Keeping silent The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.\" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 1/329; see also Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 693, 4027) This is because, in most cases, the angry person loses self-control and could utter words of kufr/disbelief (from which we seek refuge with Allah), or curses, or the word of divorce (talaq) which would destroy his home, or words of slander which would bring him the enmity and hatred of others. So, in short, keeping silent is the solution which helps one to avoid all that. Not moving The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.\" The narrator of this hadith is Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is a story connected to his telling of it: he was taking his camels to drink at a trough that he owned, when some other people came along and said (to one another), \"Who can compete with Abu Dharr (in bringing animals to drink) and make his hair stand on end?\" A man said, \"I can,\" so he brought his animals and competed with Abu Dharr, with the result that the trough was broken. [i.e., Abu Dharr was expecting help in watering his camels, but instead the man misbehaved and caused the trough to be broken]. Abu Dharr was standing, so he sat down, then he laid down. Someone asked him, \"O Abu Dharr, why did you sit down then lie down?\" He said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:...\" and quoted the hadith. (The hadith and this story may be found in Musnad Ahmad, 5/152; see also Sahih al-Jami\u2019, no. 694). According to another report, Abu Dharr was watering his animals at the trough, when another man made him angry, so he sat down... (Fayd al-Qadir, al-Manawi, 1/408) Among the benefits of this advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the fact that it prevents the angry person from going out of control, because he could strike out and injure someone, or even kill - as we will find out shortly - or he could destroy possessions and so on. Sitting down makes it less likely that one will become overexcited. Lying down makes it even less likely that he will do something crazy or harmful. Al-\u2019Allamah al-Khattabi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his commentary on Abu Dawud: \"One who is standing is in a position to strike and destroy, while the one who is sitting is less likely to do that, and the one who is lying down can do neither. It is possible that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the angry person to sit down or lie down so that he would not do something that he would later regret. And Allah knows best.\" (Sunan Abi Dawud, with Ma'alim al-Sunan, 5/141) Following the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \"Advise me.\" He said, \"Do not become angry.\" The man repeated his request several times, and each time the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him, \"Do not become angry.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 10/456) According to another report, the man said: \"I thought about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and I realized that anger combines all kinds of evil.\" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/373) Do not become angry and Paradise will be yours This is an authentic hadith. (See Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 7374. Ibn Hijr attributed it to al-Tabarani, see al-Fath 4/465) Remembering what Allah has promised to the righteous (muttaqin) who keep away from the causes of anger and struggle within themselves to control it, is one of the most effective ways of extinguishing the flames of anger. One of the hadiths that describe the great reward for doing this is: \"Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will fill his heart with contentment on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by al-Tabarani, 12/453, see also Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 6518). Another great reward is described in the Prophet\u2019s words: \"Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will call him before all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, and will let him choose of the Hur al-\u2019Iyn whoever he wants.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud, 4777, and others. It is classified as hasan (sound) in Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 6518) Knowing the high status and advantages offered to those who control themselves The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The strong man is not the one who can overpower others (in wrestling); rather, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he gets angry.\" (Reported by Ahmad, 2/236; the hadith is agreed upon). The greater the anger, the higher the status of the one who controls himself. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The strongest man is the one who, when he gets angry and his face reddens and his hackles rise, is able to defeat his anger.\" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 5/367, and classified as hasan in Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 3859) Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by some people who were wrestling. He asked, \"What is this?\" They said: \"So-and-So is the strongest, he can beat anybody.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"Shall I not tell you who is even stronger than him? The man who, when he is mistreated by another, controls his anger, has defeated his own shaytan and the shaytan of the one who made him angry.\" (Reported by al-Bazzar, and Ibn Hijr said its isnad is sahih. Al-Fath, 10/519) Following the Prophet\u2019s example in the case of anger The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is our leader and has set the highest example in this matter, as is recorded in a number of hadiths. One of the most famous was reported by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he was wearing a Najrani cloak with a rough collar. A Bedouin came and seized him roughly by the edge of his cloak, and I saw the marks left on his neck by the collar. Then the Bedouin ordered him to give him some of the wealth of Allah that he had. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he should be given something.\" (Agreed upon. Fath al-Bari, 10/375) Another way in which we can follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is by making our anger for the sake of Allah, when His rights are violated. This is the kind of anger which is praiseworthy. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became angry when he was told about the imam who was putting people off the prayer by making it too long; when he saw a curtain with pictures of animate creatures in \u2018Aishah\u2019s house; when Usamah spoke to him about the Makhzumi woman who had been convicted of theft, and he said \"Do you seek to intervene concerning one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?\"; when he was asked questions that he disliked, and so on. His anger was purely for the sake of Allah. Knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness The righteous (al-muttaqun) are those praised by Allah in the Quran and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Paradise as wide as heaven and earth has been prepared for them. One of their characteristics is that they (interpretation of the meaning) \"spend (in Allah\u2019s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, [they] repress anger, and [they] pardon men; verily, Allah loves al-muhsinun (the good-doers).\" [Al \u2018Imran 3:134] These are the ones whose good character and beautiful attributes and deeds Allah has mentioned, and whom people admire and want to emulate. One of their characteristics is that (interpretation of the meaning) \"... when they are angry, they forgive.\" [al-Shura 42:37] Listening to reminders Anger is a part of human nature, and people vary in their anger. It may be difficult for a man not to get angry, but sincere people will remember Allah when they are reminded, and they will not overstep the mark. Some examples follow: Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man sought permission to speak to \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), then he said: \"O son of al-Khattab, you are not giving us much and you are not judging fairly between us.\" \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was so angry that he was about to attack the man, but al-Hurr ibn Qays, who was one of those present, said: \"O Amir al-Mu\u2019minin, Allah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish\u2019 [al-A\u2019raf 7:199]. This man is one of the foolish.\" By Allah, \u2018Umar could go no further after al-Hurr had recited this ayah to him, and he was a man who was careful to adhere to the Book of Allah. (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 4/304) This is how the Muslim should be. The evil hypocrite was not like this when he was told the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one of the Companions said to him, \"Seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan.\" He said to the one who reminded him, \"Do you think I am crazy? Go away!\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1/465). We seek refuge with Allah from failure. Knowing the bad effects of anger The negative effects of anger are many; in short they cause damage to one\u2019s own self and to others. The angry person may utter words of slander and obscenity, he may attack others (physically) in an uncontrolled manner, even to the point of killing. The following story contains a valuable lesson: `Alqamah ibn Wail reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) told him: \"I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came to him leading another man by a rope. He said, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, this man killed my brother.\u2019 The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, \u2018Did you kill him?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, I killed him.\u2019 He asked, \u2018How did you kill him?\u2019 He said, \u2018He and I were hitting a tree to make the leaves fall, for animal feed, and he slandered me, so I struck him on the side of the head with an axe, and killed him.\u2019...\" (Reported by Muslim, 1307, edited by al-Baqi) Anger could lead to less than killing, such as wounding and breaking bones. If the one who caused the anger runs away, the angry person turns his anger on himself, so he may tear his clothes, or strike his cheeks, or have a fit, or fall unconscious, or he may break dishes and plates, or break furniture. In the worst cases, anger results in social disasters and the breaking of family ties, i.e., divorce. Ask many of those who divorced their wives, and they will tell you: it was in a moment of anger. This divorce results in misery for the children, regret and frustration, a hard and difficult life, all as a result of anger. If they had remembered Allah, come to their senses, restrained their anger and sought refuge with Allah, none of this would have happened. Going against the shari\u2019ah (Islamic law) only results in loss. The damage to health that results from anger can only be described by doctors, such as thrombosis, high blood pressure, tachycardia (abnormally rapid heartbeat) and hyperventilation (rapid, shallow breathing), which can lead to fatal heart attacks, diabetes, etc. We ask Allah for good health. The angry person should think about himself during moments of anger If the angry person could see himself in the mirror when he is angry, he would hate himself and the way he looks. If he could see the way he changes, and the way his body and limbs shake, how his eyes glare and how out of control and crazy his behaviour is, he would despise himself and be revolted by his own appearance. It is well-known that inner ugliness is even worse than outer ugliness; how happy the Shaytan must be when a person is in this state! We seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from failure. Du`a (Supplication) Du`a is always the weapon of the believer, whereby he asks Allah to protect him from evil, trouble and bad behaviour and seeks refuge with Him from falling into the pit of kufr (disbelief) or wrongdoing because of anger. One of the three things that can help save him is: being fair at times of contentment and of anger (Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 3039). One of the Du`as of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was: \"O Allah, by Your knowledge of the Unseen and Your power over Your creation, keep me alive for as long as You know life is good for me, and cause me to die when You know death is good for me. O Allah, I ask You to make me fear You in secret and in public, and I ask You to make me speak the truth in times of contentment and of anger. I ask You not to let me be extravagant in poverty or in prosperity. I ask You for continuous blessings, and for contentment that does not end. I ask You to let me accept Your decree, and for a good life after death. I ask You for the joy of seeing Your face and for the longing to meet You, without going through diseases and misguiding fitnah (trials). O Allah, adorn us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who are guided. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\" For more about issues related to anger, please see these answers: 42505, 22034 and 82400. And Allah knows best.",

I had been very careful not to exceed on this card what I could pay for every month so that I would not have to pay any interest. During one time of some difficulty I could not pay the entire bill and it incured the interest. After several months I was able to pay it off with the help of my husband who had also used it from time to time. After the bill was paid I told him that I wanted to get rid of the card so that we would not risk falling into this condition again. However my husband wanted me to apply for a card in his name since I was planning to gat rid of mine. He had previously had 2 credit cards of his own which he was unable to pay off. He became very angry and insulting, so to keep the peace I got it for him. He also said that he would be responsible for it if he couldn't pay it. I have not used the card at all and for the past 6 months he has not been able to pay the entire balance so for all that time it is gathering interest. my question is who is accountable before Allah for this card?

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. There is absolutely nothing wrong with calling the athaan in the musallah; on the contrary, it is better than abandoning it altogether. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught two men who were traveling how to make the call for prayer while traveling, where no mosques or musallahs may be found. As was narrated in the hadeeth saheah by Malik Ibn Al-Huwayrith: \"My cousin and I came to the Prophet SAWS and he said to us, \u2018If you travel, (meaning while you are traveling) perform the call for prayer, and call the iqamah before prayer and let the older one of you be the Imam.\" Narrated by Al Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari hadeeth #658 and Al Tirmidhi, hadeeth #189. According to Abu Eissa (Al Tirmidhi) this hadeeth is hasan saheeh. There were two views on the hadeeth. The majority of the Muslim scholars agreed on the validity of calling the aathaan while traveling. Others however, have said that the iqamah alone is sufficient, and that the purpose of the aathaan is to gather people for prayer. According to Ahmad and Ishaaq, the first view is more sound. In another Hadeeth narrated by \u2018Ukbah bin \u2018Aamir he said: I heard the Prophet say, \"Allaah is pleased by a shepherd who, while on the top of a mountain, calls for prayer and prays. Allaah the Almighty says, \u2018Look at my worshipperhe calls the aathaan, and he prays; he fears me. I have forgiven my worshipper, and I have sent him to heaven ( meaning that Allah chose for this person to go to heaven).\u2019\" Narrated by Al-Nisaa\u2019i, Abu Dawood, and Ahmad and was confirmed sound by Al Albany in his book Saheeh Al-Jami\u2019, Hadeeth #8102. The benefits of the aathaan are many and they are by no means limited to gathering people, or announcing prayer time. They encompass: repelling Satan, getting rewarded in the afterlife for calling for prayer, and furthermore, for announcing and repeating the oneness of Allaah, etc. Allaah knows best.",

The conditions for a non-Muslim woman to marry a Muslim man are that she should be of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian) and that she should be chaste. We remind the Muslims living outside the Muslim world that they should not rush into taking such a step, and if they wish to do so, they should think long and hard, even though marrying a woman of the People of the Book is permitted in principle. There is a very real possibility of the children becoming Christian, especially in countries where the law favours the non-Muslim mother. In fact many such tragedies have occurred.

        "question": "A young girl has finished reading the Qur\u2019aan for the first time, and wants to invite her friends for a celebration on this occasion. What should she write on the invitation cards?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. This is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim country and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a sign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the purposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small gathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl\u2019s friends, tell them of her achievement in completing the Qur\u2019aan in order to encourage them - not to show off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the Qur\u2019aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the Qur\u2019aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and give thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one is careful not to let it turn into a celebration. It is clear from the above that celebrating a person\u2019s completion of reciting or memorizing the Qur\u2019aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which there is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): (1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and (2) that it may constitute bid\u2019ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part of the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the Qur\u2019aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere towards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and friends. We should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah I ask Allaah to increase His blessings upon you and to give you the strength to memorize Qur\u2019aan and Sincerity in speech and deeds.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. The punishment for apostasy (riddah) is well-known in Islaamic Sharee\u2019ah. The one who leaves Islaam will be asked to repent by the Sharee\u2019ah judge in an Islaamic country; if he does not repent and come back to the true religion, he will be killed as a kaafir and apostate, because of the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"Whoever changes his religion, kill him.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3017). It is well-known in Sharee\u2019ah that the punishments (hudood) are not carried out on minors, because they have not yet reached the age of responsibility; but in the case of those who have reached the age of responsibility, the punishment (hadd) applies, without a doubt. The person who knows the truth and believes in it, then turns his back on it, does not deserve to live. The punishment for apostasy is prescribed for the protection of the religion and as a deterrent to anyone who is thinking of leaving Islaam. There is no doubt that such a serious crime must be met with an equally weighty punishment. If the kuffaar do not give people the freedom to cross a red light, how can we give freedom to people to leave Islaam and disbelieve in Allaah when they want to? It seems that the intention of the teacher mentioned in the question was to shock the students with news of this ruling, in order to mislead them from the way of Allaah.

This is the case if one\u2019s relatives are righteous, but if they are kaafirs or are wrongdoers, then cutting off ties with them for the sake of Allaah is how one maintains the tie, on the condition that one tries to warn them, and tells them that the reason for cutting the ties is because of their deviation from the truth. At the same time, the connection of making du\u2019aa\u2019 for them should remain, and you should pray for them in their absence that Allaah will guide them to the Right Path.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Benefits of converting to Islam It brought us great joy to hear from the noble inquirer expressing interest in accepting Islam. Islam is indeed the religion that links the human being to his Lord directly via the belief in the oneness of God and through various acts of worship. Also\u0648 Islam instills peace of mind and an inner serenity to the created human being, embodied in a unique relationship and devout tranquillity, encompassing love for, fear of, hope from, and submission to God Almighty, Allah. Indeed, this essence is the true meaning of worship, which comprises and combines acts of the heart with acts of the tongue in remembering God, in addition to the acts of the physical organs. This is manifested through prayer, fasting, paying zakah (the poor due), and reading the Noble Quran, among other acts, which you will find resulting in positive and benevolent effects in yourself, God willing (in sha Allah). No doubt that if you decide to accept Islam that the conclusion which you will have reached was due to two things: (1) a sound mind and (2) success granted from God (Allah). How to convert to Islam As for converting to Islam, it is a very simple and easy thing, consisting of your pronouncing the two testimonies of faith.

(It is reported by Ahmad and it is in sahih Al Jahni 4150.) Tell your friend that he has to increase in good deeds so that Allah will wipe out his evil deeds, as Abdullah ibn Masud reported. He said that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, Oh Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), I met a woman in the garden so I pulled her close, fondled her, kissed her, and did everything with except have intercourse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was then silent and so the verse came down, \"verily, the good deeds erase the bad deeds, that is admonition to those who remember.\" So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called him and recited it to him. So Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, Oh Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is this for him specifically or for everyone. He said (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), no, for everyone.' (It was narrated by Ahmad.) There are more details on repenting from fornication. Refer to question #624. As for your question regarding whether he is considered to have committed fornication, which is punishable by stoning, it is obligatory that the married fornicator be stoned and the unmarried fornicator receive lashes. This is only if the sexual organs of the fornicator penetrate the vagina of the woman. Whatever is similar deserves a different punishment, depending on the level of the haram committed. It is not obligatory that he admit to a judge what he did. It is sufficient that repentance take place between him and Allah, and Allah is the Acceptor of repentance and the Most Merciful.

        "question": "I have heard in certain lectures given by the shaikhs here in America who consider themselves Salafee, say things like this: My mother is a kafira and I KNOW she is going to hell. Saying that they know for sure that a certain person is going to hell. Is this permissible in Islam? Can we say that a certain person is going to Jahannam because of their religion?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jamaa\u2019ah, the basic principle is that the issue of who will go to Paradise and who will go to Hell is the matter of \u2018aqeedah based on what is said in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, and there is no room for reasoning or ijtihaad in this matter. If the Qur\u2019aan or Sunnah says that a specific person will be in Paradise or Hell, we bear witness to that. At the same time we hope that those who do good will go to Paradise and fear that those who do bad will go to Hell, but Allaah knows best how people will end up. The issue of saying who will go to Paradise or Hell may be divided into two categories: General statements, which have to do with people\u2019s qualities, such as saying, \u201cWhoever associates anything with Allaah in an act of major shirk is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, and will be in Hell.\u201d Similarly we say that whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the hope of receiving reward will be forgiven his previous and future sins, and that an acceptable Hajj has no other reward but Paradise. There are many such statements in the Qur\u2019aan and saheeh Sunnah. If a person asks, \u201cWill the one who calls on anything other than Allaah and seeks the help of anyone but Allaah be in Paradise or Hell?\u201d we would say that he is a kaafir who will be in Hell, if he is shown clear evidence that he is wrong but he stills persists and dies believing that. If it were said, Whoever does Hajj then does not commit any obscene or immoral act, and dies after his Hajj, for example, what will his fate be? We would say that he is in Paradise. Or the person whose last words in this life are Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will be in Paradise, and so on. All of this has to do with people\u2019s qualities and does not apply to any specific, named person. Specific statements referring to people by name, stating that a particular person will be in Paradise or in Hell. This is not permissible except in cases where Allaah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have informed us of it. Whoever Allaah or His Messenger have mentioned by name and stated that they will be in Paradise are definitely among the people of Paradise, such as the ten who were given the good news of Paradise (al-\u2018asharah al-mubashsharah), foremost among whom are the four Khulafa\u2019, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, \u2018Umar, \u2018Uthmaan and \u2018Ali, may Allaah be pleased with them. Those who the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah mention by name and state that they will be in Hell are definitely among the people of Hell, such as Abu Lahab and his wife, Abu Taalib, \u2018Amr ibn Lahiy, and others. We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reading Yasin for one who is dying We have to make a distinction here between the two issues: reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying, and reading it for one who has died. With regard to reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying, this practice has been reported from some of the Companions. Imam Ahmad reported in his Musnad from Safwan: \u201cMy shaykhs told me that they were with Ghudayf ibn al-Harith al-Thumani when he was dying. He said: \u2018Can any of you read Yasin?\u2019 So Salih ibn Shurayh al-Sakuni recited it, and when he reached the fortieth verse, Ghudayf passed away. My shaykhs used to say that when it is recited in the presence of one who is dying, it eases the pain of death.\u201d That was the opinion of Safwan. \u2018Isa ibn al-Mu\u2019tamir read it for Ibn Mab\u2019ad (when the latter was dying).\u201d (Al-Musnad, 16355) Al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil, 3/152: \u201cThis is a sahih sanad going back to Ghudayf ibn al-Harith, may Allah be pleased with him. Its men are thiqat apart from \u2018the shaykhs\u2019 who are not named and are therefore unknown (majhul). But the fact that they are unknown is compensated for by their large number, especially since they are of the generation of the Tabi\u2019in (Successors)...\u201d Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 fi Ahkam al-Janaiz: \u201cSurat Yasin may be recited over him (i.e., the one who is dying) for the one who thinks that the hadith is correct.\u201d He explained that this is because this surah contains good news of Paradise, as in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cIt was said: \u2018Enter Paradise.\u2019...\u201d [Yasin 36:26], and because it makes the passage of the soul easier, and other reasons. Reading Surat Yasin for the dead As regards reading Surat Yasin for one who has died, there is no sahih hadith to indicate that this should be done. A hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud and others which says \u201cRead Yasin over your dead\u201d, but this hadith is not sahih because its isnad contains contradictions and narrators who are unknown (majhul). This was stated by al-\u2018Allamah al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, hadith no. 688. Reading Quran over the dead is considered to be a bid`ah (innovation), as he states at the end of his book Ahkam al-Janaiz. Some people think that it should be read forty times over the deceased, and some of them may distribute copies of the Quran among the mourners who gather to offer condolences so that they may read, or organize gatherings in the mosque to read it for the soul of the deceased. All of this has no basis whatsoever (in the sunnah), and these are innovated deeds of bid`ah which we should avoid and warn others against. And Allah is the Source of strength.

Please guide me in the ways of Islam, so as not to hurt our family relationship.. Thank you..",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First of all, you should hasten to enter Islam, which is easy to do. An explanation of what is involved may be found under Question 114. (See also Questions 122, 158 and 177). Secondly, if this lady becomes a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Christian or Jewish), repents to Allaah for the forbidden relationship, and remains chaste, then it is permissible for you to marry her. Thirdly, the children who were born to this woman outside of marriage are not your children; they cannot take your name and must take her name. However, this should not prevent you from treating them kindly, taking care of them and spending on them. In the future, you should try to call them and their mother to Islaam. Fourthly, going to her church and attending rituals of kufr is not advisable, because of the possible negative consequences. We advise you not to do that, but this should not be any obstacle to your entering Islam. If you were to say that it is a choice of either embracing Islam and going to the church with her, or not embracing Islam at all, we would definitely tell you to embrace Islam. But we would like you to think of the meaning of these two soorahs of the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meanings): \"Say: He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need; He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.\"[al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4] \"Say: O Kaafiroon (disbelievers in Allaah, in His Oneness, etc.)! I worship not that which you worship, Nor will you worship that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping. Nor will you worship that which I worship To you be your religion, and to me my religion (Islaamic monotheism).\"[al-Kaafiroon 109:1-6] Finally I advise you, a wise man who is striving to make the right choice, hasten to enter Islam and practise it: Allaah will help you to overcome all obstacles. May Allaah take care of you.",
        "summary": "If this woman becomes a Christian or Jewish, repents to the prohibition of the relationship between Allaah and the Book, then it's legal for you to be married her. If this lady becomes non-believer in Allaah, observes the kufr, or remains chaste, then it is now permissible for you marry her. The children who were brought up by this woman will not inherit your name. You cannot take her name and/or call her and their mother Islaam; therefore, they are not yours children. Similarly, the children that were born outside of marriage to this woman \"cannot take your name.\" Therefore, even if she becomes a Muslim, she will not be legally obligated to marry him. She will remain chaste, however, and he will be free to marry her as long as he obeys Allaah and adheres to his religion. In the meantime, the family members of the child who were born after marriage will no longer be your children. As for the children whose parents were born before marriage, they do not have the right to inherit their father's name. Lastly, there are no al-Ikhlasas 112,1-4,3,6,7,8,9,10,16,17,18,1921,2021,2221,2521,2321,2421,2621,2721,2921,and2521 respectively. These are the words of the soorah, which states that the self-sufficient master of all creatures need, neither eats nor drink. There is none coequal or comparable to Him. All co-equal and comparable unto Him. May Allaah bless you.",

        "question": "A person wanted to borrow money from one of the banks without paying interest, because interest is considered to be ribaa. But one of the managers in that bank told him: If you want to avoid ribaa, you can take a million from us, and one year later, if you can afford it, you can give us two million, one million which is due to us, and another million which we will keep for one year in return for the year during which you kept our million. After one year, you can take your million back. Is this considered to be ribaa or not? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This is the essence of ribaa, and is not permitted under any circumstances, because the purpose of lending is to help Muslims. It was narrated from Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a loan is like an act of charity. If the bank lends you one million riyaals for a period of one year, and after that year passes you return the million that you borrowed and add another million for them to keep for a year in return for their loan to you, this is haraam according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cEvery loan which brings benefits is ribaa.\u201d (this version narrated by al-Baghawi). The bank lent you one million riyaals on the condition that you give them one million more than what is due to them, so that they can buy and sell with it and keep the profits for themselves. This condition brings benefits, so it is an invalid condition according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. All that you have to do is to give the bank the million that you borrowed from them, and not another million to benefit from for a year. This is not permissible according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. The bank is not entitled to anything except getting its money back, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messengerbut if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums).\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:278-289]",
        "summary": "A loan is like charity. The purpose of a loan is ribaa, which is to give money back to the bank. The bank cannot lend money for a long period of time unless you give them enough money to buy and sell some of the product they are making. This condition does not count as a loan, because it is not allowed under any circumstances. A loan that brings costs is called ribaa. In other words, the bank lends money for one year, but only after that year has passed. You can't ask for more than what's due to you; instead, you must give the bank exactly what you borrowed from the previous year. If you don't do it, take notice of War from Allaah and his Messenger but if you repent or want to be treated with war, then take an notice of war so that the whole thing goes away.",

        "question": "Why are adultery, gambling, eating the flesh of swine forbidden in Islam or consedered \"haram\"?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Even though we find it strange that a Muslim would ask such a question about matters which are so clear and undisputed, the answer is simply that these things are haraam because Allaah, Whom we must obey, has forbidden them. He tells us in the Qur\u2019aan (interpretation of the meanings): \u201cAnd come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil way.\u201d [al-Israa\u2019 17:32] \u201cHe has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine...\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:173] \u201cO you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [stone altars for sacrifice to false gods], and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan\u2019s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah. So, will you not then abstain?\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:90-91] So we must avoid all that which Allaah has forbidden, out of faith in His laws, in the hope of His reward and in fear of His punishment. We must also believe that Allaah does not forbid anything in Islamic sharee\u2019ah except that which is harmful and corrupt, whether we understand this rationally or not, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:65]",
        "summary": "The answer to this question is simply that they must obey Allaah. The interpretation of the meaning of the words, \"Haraam,\" which means \"come not near unlawful sexual intercourse\", is an abomination because it is a sin and evil way. It is also an adulterous way of seeking luck in order to obtain luck or decision. Similarly, alcohol, tobacco, and other intoxicants are all sinful ways, just as gambling, alansaab, stone altars for sacrifices to false gods, and alazlaam are an abominable way. As for abstaining, well, you can do whatever you want until you accept your decisions and accept them with complete submission.",

That is unless the additional money, which has come after the beginning of the year is a result and proceeds from the original money.

I've heard some reasons as to why people yawn during prayer, all of them having to do with Shaytan. It seems that I always yawn when I pray. Is there any remedy by the Prophet as to how to stop it? And how wrong is it that I yawn?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yawning in Islam There follow a number of the Prophets\u2019 teachings on this matter: Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Yawning is from the Shaytan. If any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as possible, for if any of you says Ha (makes a noise when yawning), the Shaytan laughs.\" (Al-Bukhari no. 3289) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Allah loves the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning. If any one of you sneezes and praises Allah, it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say Yarhamak Allah (May Allah have mercy on you). As for yawning, it is from Shaytan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, for if any of you yawns, the Shaytan laughs at him.\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 6226) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Yawning is from Shaytan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can.\" (Muslim, 2994) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Sneezing is from Allah and yawning is from Shaytan. If any of you yawns, let him place his hand over his mouth. If he says Ah, ah! (makes a noise when yawning), Shaytan laughs from inside him.\" Abu \u2018Isa said: this is a sahih hasan hadith. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2746; classified as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 4130) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Allah loves sneezing and dislikes yawning. If any one of you sneezes and says Al-hamdu Lillah, it is a duty on everyone who hears him to say Yarhamak Allah. As for yawning, if any one of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, and do not say Hah, hah (do not make a noise when yawning), for this is from Shaytan and he laughs at it.\" Abu \u2018Isa said: This is a sahih hadith. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2747) Abu Said al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If any of you yawns, let him cover his mouth lest the Shaytan enter.\" (Abu Dawud) Abu Said al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as possible, lest the Shaytan enter his mouth.\" (Imam Ahmad) According to another report also narrated by Imam Ahmad, Shaytan enters when a person yawns. (Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 426) What to do if you yawn From the reports quoted above, we may summarize the following: \u00b7 That Shaytan prompts the human to yawn, which is indicative of laziness and sluggishness. \u00b7 That Shaytan enters the person who yawns. \u00b7 That Shaytan laughs at man and makes fun of his ugly appearance when he is in that state. What to do if you yawn while praying The person who is praying must take care of the following: \u00b7 He should resist yawning. \u00b7 He should cover his mouth. \u00b7 He should suppress his voice (not make a sound). And Allah knows best.",

        "question": "When is the month of Ramadan and can someone like me fast properly? What time of the day am I supposed to fast?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The fact that you have concern with the blessed month of Ramadhan, are questioning it's arrival, and anticipating it, is very wonderful. It indicates that you are affected by this great Islamic worship, which consists of abstaining from food and drink, and sexual intercourse from fajr (the break of dawn), until maghrib ( the sunset) during the day of the noble month of Ramadhan. As far as it's appointed time, my dear respected questioner, the laws of worship in Islam are scheduled according to proof which is clearly traceable and detectable. The evidence which is seen is not estimated. This entails the sighting of the moon, which indicates that the month of Ramadhan has begun. So, if we see the new moon, or it is established that someone amongst us has seen the new moon, then it becomes obligatory on the entire Muslim community to fast every day of this month, until we see the new moon for the following month of Shawwal and know that therefore Ramadhan has ended. The month of Ramadhan on the Islamic calendar could be 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the physical proof, which is the new moon. According to the Christian calender, the approximate time of Ramadhan this year would occur on the 30th or 31st of December 1997. In order for your fast to be correct and accepted, you must first enter Islam by testifying to Allah's Oneness and believing in the Prophet and following the laws of Islam. We would be happy to see you living a happy life with strong faith, and good years to come, spending them inspired by Islam. We ask Allah to protect you and guide you along.",

I have promised with my sincerest intentions that if we do get married and have children, they will follow Islam. Is there any way of us getting married without me converting and I would also appreciate if I could be told where I can read more on this subject. Thank You.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the noble inquirer: You have traversed an important part of the path to the truth and directing yourself towards it. From what I have been able to gather from your question, I understand that you wish to embrace Islam but what is preventing you from doing so is fear for your sick mother's health upon hearing the news. I want you to know that overcoming this obstacle is an easy matter, as it is possible for you in a practical way, to conceal your acceptance of Islam and not divulge it. You are not required to announce your acceptance of Islam in an Islamic center or anywhere else; all that is required is the pronouncing of the two testimonies of faith (see question(s) ) and the initiation of practicing the rites of the religion. You can pray in private, undisclosed places, for example. In addition, fasting will not be difficult as you can easily advance any appropriate excuse for not eating if something is offered to you during the daylight hours of the month of fasting. Now, I would like to remind you of two things: Firstly, that the driving factor and underlying truth regarding wanting to embrace the religion must be to gain the pleasure and acceptance of your Lord--Allaah, the Most Glorified and All-High, who does not accept any religion other than Islam, as He has said in his Glorious Book (the Qur'aan), [interpretation of the meaning]: \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam--it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.\" (The Family of Imran, verse 3:85) It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah, may Allaah be please with him, that Allaah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: \"By Him in whose hand Muhammad's soul is (i.e., God, Allaah), there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations to whom I have been sent) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islamic monotheism), but he will be among the dwellers of the Hellfire.\" (Sahih Muslim, Book of Faith, #240). Thus, your objectives in entering Islam are to save yourself from being among the permanent dwellers of Hell in the Hereafter, and to achieve the fantastic reward of the bliss of Heaven, the vastness of which is greater than that of the earth and the skies. Your overriding motive for accepting Islam should not be emotions stemming from your relationship with the Muslim man with whom you are in love. Your embracing Islam is something necessary for yourself whether you marry this man or not. Secondly, obeying God (Allaah) and His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has a higher priority than your closest relative and most beloved dear one even if it is your mother or your spouse or anyone else. The Prophet of guidance has said : \"There are three qualities, for which whoever is characterized by them will relish the sweetness of faith: one to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; one who loves a man only for Allaah's sake; and one who abhors returning to apostasy after Allaah has rescued him from it as he abhors being cast into Hell.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Faith, #15). He also said: \"No worshipper (and in the hadeeth narrated by 'Abdul-Warith, no person) is a truthful believer, until I am dearer to him than the members of his household, his wealth and the whole of mankind.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Faith #14). I ask Allaah to hasten you to Islam and to help you firmly establish yourself in it, and to grant you a righteous and successful marriage as well as a blessed family. Indeed, Allaah is the One who guides to the path of truth, success, and righteousness. Please see Subject area :Issues Relevant to New Muslims and Accepting Islam.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. All praise be to Allaah, who guides New Muslims and accepting Islam. The narrator emphasizes the importance of secrecy in order to ensure that New Muslim does not reveal his or her acceptance of Islam. He also reminds New Muslim that he is only asking because he wants to know what the real reason for wanting to embrace Islam is: fear for his mother's health. Accepting Islam will not be as difficult as hiding your acceptance from society. In fact, you will be able to advance any excuse for skipping meals if something is given to you during daylight hours of January fasting.",

        "question": "Assalamu Alaikum A brother was telling me that wearing clothing below the ankles is haram and that there are many hadiths that prove this. I would appreciate your opinion on this matter. Jazakallah",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. What your friend has told you is true. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid isbaal (wearing ones clothes below the ankles), for example: Al-Bukhaari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whatever of the izaar (lower garment) is below the ankles is in the Fire.\" (al-Bukhaari, no. 5787) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"There are three whom Allaah will not look at or praise on the Day of Judgement and theirs will be a painful punishment: the one who wears his garment below his ankles, the one who reminds others of his favours, and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths\" (reported by Muslim, no. 106) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Isbaal (wearing ones garment below the ankles) may apply to the izaar (lower garment), the shirt or the turban. Whoever allows any part of these to trail on the ground out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.\" (reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4085, and al-Nisaai, no. 5334, with a saheeh isnaad). Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah will not look at the one who wears his lower garment below his ankles.\" (Reported by al-Nisaai in al-Mujtabaa, Kitaab al-Zeenah, Baab Isbaal al-Izaar). Hudhayfah said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took hold of the muscle of my calf (or his calf) and said, This is where the izaar should stop; if you insist, it may be lower, but it should not reach the ankles.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; see Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 1783) All of the ahaadeeth quoted above speak against isbaal, whether or not the intention is to show off; but if a person does this deliberately out of arrogance, there is no doubt that his sin is greater. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah will not look at the one who trails his izaar on the ground out of pride.\" (al-Bukhaari, no. 5788) Jaabir ibn Sulaym said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: Beware of wearing ones lower garment below the ankles, because this is a kind of showing-off, and Allaah does not love showing-off.\" (Regarded as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2722). No one is able to be completely free of pride and arrogance, even if he claims that this is so. Such a claim is unacceptable, because by saying it, he is praising himself. Only in the case of those whom the wahy (revelation) testified that they were free of pride do we believe that this is the case. For example, there is a hadeeth which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.\" Abu Bakr said to him, \"O Messenger of Allaah, my izaar slips down if I do not pay attention to it.\" He said: \"You are not one of those who do it out of pride.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5784) What indicates that isbaal is prohibited even if it is not done out of pride is the hadeeth of Abu Saeed al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The lower garment of the Muslim should come down to mid-calf, but there is nothing wrong if it is between that point and the ankles. Whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire. Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4093, with a saheeh isnaad.) These ahaadeeth describe two different deeds, for which there will be two different punishments: Imaam Ahmad reported that Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Yaqoob said: \"I asked Abu Saeed: Did you hear anything from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the izaar (lower garment)? he said, Yes, listen! The izaar of the believer should come to mid-calf, although there is nothing wrong if it comes between there and the ankles, but whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire, and he said it three times.\" Ibn Umar said: \"I passed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and my izaar had slipped down. He said, O Abdullaah, pull up your izaar! so I pulled it up. He said, More! so I pulled it up more, and always made sure it was pulled up properly after that.\" Some people asked, \"To where did you pull it up?\" He said, \"To mid-calf length.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2086; al-Dhahabi, Kitaab al-Kabaair, 131-132) The issue of isbaal applies to women just as much as it applies to men. This is indicated by the hadeeth of Ibn Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him. Umm Salamah said: O Messenger of Allaah, what should women do with their hems? He said, Let them go down a handspan. She asked, What if their feet show? He said, Let them lengthen it by a cubit, but no more.\" (al-Nisaa'i, Kitaab al-zeenah, Baab dhuyool al-nisaa). The punishment for showing off may come to pass in this world, not in the Hereafter. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whilst a man was walking arrogantly admiring himself and his clothes, Allaah caused the earth to swallow him and he is suffering in it until the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2088).",

        "question": "My father passed away about two weeks ago. I wanted to know when me or my family members go to his grave, is he able to hear us and what we are saying to him?... And if not, is there any way we can have him hear what we say?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can the dead hear the living? The principle is that the dead do not hear the words of the living, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"but you cannot make hear those in the graves.\" [Fatir 35:22] and \"Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear\" [al-Naml 27:80] When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed the slain disbelievers after the Battle of Badr, Allah caused them to hear his words, although they were at the bottom of the well in which they had been buried. This was a special case, as the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, have stated. (See Al-Ayat al-Bayyinat fi \u2018adam Sama\u2019 al-Amwat). Perhaps the psychological motive for wishing that your father could hear you is an attempt to do something to re-establish the communication that has been cut, in order to alleviate the pain you are feeling. What benefits the dead in Islam? You should understand, my sister, that Islam has explained what actions on the part of the living may benefit the dead, and what may reach them in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity, e.g. a waqf or endowment), beneficial knowledge (which he has left behind), or a righteous child who will pray for him.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no 1376; he said this is a sahih hasan hadith) The most important thing that will benefit your father after his death, and that you can do for him now that he is in his grave, is to strive to pray for him and ask for forgiveness and mercy for him, and for Paradise and salvation from the Fire, and other good and beautiful du`as (prayers). Prayers for forgiveness offered by both sons and daughters of the deceased bring great benefits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"A man\u2019s status will be raised in Paradise and he will ask, How did I get here? He will be told, By your son\u2019s du\u2019as (prayers) for forgiveness for you.\" (Reported by Ibn Majah, no 3660; see also Sahih al-Jami, 1617) Another thing that may reach the deceased is sadaqah (charity) given on his behalf, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"My mother has passed away, and if she could have spoken, she would have given something in charity. Will she receive a reward if I give something on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 1388) Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the mother of Sa\u2019d ibn Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) died when he was away from her. He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and I am away from her. Will it benefit her anything if I give in charity on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then I ask you to be my witness that I am giving my garden al-Mikhraf (so called because it bore so many dates) in charity on her behalf.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 2756) Abu Hurayrah reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"My father has died and left money behind. He did not make a wasiyyah (a will); will it expiate for his sins if I give some of it in charity on his behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" (Reported by al-Nasai) Sa'd ibn Ubadah said: \"I said: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died. Should I give charity on her behalf? He said, Yes. I asked, What kind of charity is best? He said, Providing water.\" (Reported by al-Nasai) Other deeds that may also benefit the dead Other deeds that may also benefit the deceased are Hajj and \u2018Umrah on their behalf, after the living person has first performed Hajj and \u2018Umrah on his or her own behalf. \u2018Abdullah ibn Buraydah reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"While I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a woman came to him and said: I gave my mother a slave-woman in charity, and now my mother has died. He said: You have got your reward, and your right of inheritance has brought your gift back to you. She said, O Messenger of Allah, she still had one month to fast. Can I fast it on her behalf? He said, Fast it on her behalf. She said, She never went to Hajj. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf? He said, Perform Hajj on her behalf.\" (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, no. 1149) This shows that it is also permissible to fast on behalf of the deceased. Another thing that may benefit the deceased is to fulfil their nadhr (vow), because Ibn \u2018Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: \"My mother made a vow to perform Hajj but she died before she could do it. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes, perform Hajj on her behalf. Don't you think that if your mother owed a debt you would pay it off?\" She said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then pay off what is owed to Allah, for Allah is more deserving of having vows fulfilled.\" (al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 7315) Another thing that may benefit the deceased is if his relative devotes a share to him of a sacrifice he offers. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sacrifice, he said: \"In the name of Allah, O Allah, on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad\" (reported by Muslim, no. 1967) and the family of Muhammad included both the living and the dead. The question of whether women may visit graves has already been addressed (please see question# 127 ) You should also know that keeping yourself busy with praying for your father is more important and better for you, and more beneficial to the deceased, than thinking about whether he can hear your voice. So try to do whatever will be of benefit both to him and you. You and your family should avoid forbidden innovations (bid\u2019ah) such as marking the fortieth day after death, or the passing of one year since the death, or gatherings for reciting al-Fatihah (the first chapter of surah of the Quran), doing forbidden acts at graves, and so on, deeds which are done by those who are ignorant and are imitated by others. I ask Allah to forgive your father and have mercy on him and on all the deceased Muslims, for He is the Forgiving, Most Merciful. For more, please see these answers: 9979, 43138, and 9304.

        "question": "What is the ruling on touching the wife and the status of wudu? Does touching the wife cause breaking of wudu?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In this issue, the strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu, unless there is a discharge of sperm. This is the statement of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) and it is also from \u2018Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) as well as Hasan, Mujahid, and Qatadah. It is also of the madhhab of Abu Hanifah. Ibn Jarir supports this statement, as well as At-Tabari and Sheikh Al-Islam ibn Taimiyyah. The people who support this statement, use as proof the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, \"I was sleeping in front of the Messenger of Allah and my legs were in his qiblah. When he prostrated he touched me and I withdrew my legs, and when he stood I stretched them out\". (Homes in those days did not have lamps.) (Al-Bukhari,328) They also use the hadith where `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) says, \"I noticed the Messenger of Allah was gone one evening from the bed, so I looked for him and my hand landed on the sole of his feet and he was in the mosque. They were close together and he was saying, \"O Allah I seek refuge with You, pleasure from Your anger, and with Your pardon, and from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from what is falsely attributed to You as praise. You are how You have praised Yourself\". (Muslim, 486) An-Nawawi states in explaining this hadith that `Aisha\u2019s statement, \"and my hand landed on the soles of his feet when he was in the mosque and they were close together,\" is proof for the one who says that touching the wife does not break wudu. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah says the statement of Allah, \"Or ye have been in contact with women\" refers to sex as Ibn Abbas and others from the Arabs have said. It is reported by \u2018Ali and others, and it is the correct meaning of the verse. There is nothing showing that touching one's wife breaks wudu in the Quran or Sunnah. The Muslims used to touch their wives all the time and not one of the Muslims reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered anyone to make wudu because of touching women.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The one and only religion that Allaah, the Most Gracious, accepts is Islam. This religion has one path, one direction and is based on one methodologythat which the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace be upon him) followed along with his comrades. This religion which Allaah has chosen for mankind is not subdivided into different sects nor does it divert into different paths. However, a number of people have gone astray and corrupted the religion, forming many different groups that bear no relation to Islam, examples of which are Al-Baatiniya,, Al-Qadyaninya, and the Bahaa\u2019iya, among which Allaah the Most Exalted and Glorious has warned us in the Holy Qur\u2019aan: \" And verily this (i.e. Allah\u2019s commandments mentioned in the previous two verses 151 and 152) is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al- Muttaqoon ( the pious-see V2:2) \" Verse # 153, Surat Al An\u2019aam. As for the second part of the question, the noble inquirer must know that Islam came down from the heavens in the form of divine revelations and inspirations to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Islam is the religion that Allaah has accepted for his worshippers, and has chosen it to mark the final completion of all that preceded it and thus supercede and be the seal for all religions. Therefore, it is not possible to say that Islam was influenced by other religions (as it was revealed by God, Allaah, the Almighty). We hope that you will read more about this religion and we ask Allaah to guide you to the True Path.",

Is it wrong for me to continue to refuse to have anything to do with him or his family. I DO NOT wish to forget or forgive, especially, when there is no change in his behavior. Any Advice is appreciated.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. If you want to deal with him on the basis of justice, then it is permissible for you to respond in like to his unkind words, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And if you punish (your enemy), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted\" [al-Nahl 16:126]. But if you bear it with patience, that will be better for you, as Allaah says at the end of the same aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \" But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for al-saabireen (the patient ones).\" [al-Nahl 16:126] If you want to turn enmity into love, then treat him well, if he treats you badly, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.\" [Fussilat 41:34] The words, \"The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal\" mean that there is a huge difference between the two. \"Repel (the evil) with one which is better,\" means that when someone treats you badly, answer back with something better, as 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"There is no better punishment for the person who sinned by being bad to you, than your obeying Allaah by being good to him in return.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allaah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off; I treat them well, but they treat me badly; I try to be kind to them, but they are cruel to me.\" He said: \"If you are as you say, it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. You will continue to have support from Allaah against them so long as you continue doing that.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2558) Our advice to you, our sister, is to be tolerant and forgiving. Follow your mother's advice. It is clear from your question that this man has room to regret and retract his bad actions. Allaah tells us (interpetation of the meaning): \" whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allaah\" [al-Shoora 42:40] However, all of this does not prevent us from protecting ourselves from the evil and harm that such relatives may cause. If going to their houses, for example, will cause some kind of offence or harm, then the relationship can be limited to telephone calls, kind words, the occasional gift and so on. The relationship can be maintained at a distance, if being too close will cause problems. We ask Allaah to guide us all, to help us not to bear any grudges towards anyone, and to treat one another properly. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah and the Prophet for understanding and correcting his harsh words. If you're dealing with a person who has offended you, then it's okay to respond in kind to his unfriendly words. However, if you want enmity to be turned into love, or serve Allaah by obeying him in return, then that will be even better. Lastly, we learn from another source that there are some examples of people who have come to the Prophet saying that they have relatives who cut them off, but they still treat them well. The Prophet says that this is as if he were putting hot ashes on their mouths. This is not true. In fact, according to al-Shoorah, \"Whoever forgives and retracts his bad actions\" will be rewarded by Allaah.",

I have been informed that I have no problems being a Muslim and having a guide dog due to my disability. However, I am concerned at the reaction that I get from other Muslims when I approach an Islamic Center. I do not want to offend but without the assistance of the guide dog I am unable to travel to a Masjid or Islamic center alone. With who should I discuss this situation i.e., an Imam? I sometimes feel I am at a \"stalemate\". Thank you for your help.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.) To the dear noble inquirer: You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern over what you may face vis-\u00e0-vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is simple and much easier to deal with than you may think. You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable according to Islamic shari\u2019ah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing. I can\u2019t imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing. In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) [translation of the meaning]: \"Verily Allaah has said, \u2018If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him for them Heaven.\u2019 \" (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653) We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. For breast-feeding to have the effect of making a child a relative (mahram), two conditions must be met: (1) The number of breast-feedings should be five or more, because of the hadith of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: \"When the Qur\u2019an was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1452). (2) This should happen within the first two years of the child\u2019s life, because of the hadith: \"Harmalah ibn Yahya told us that \u2018Abdullah ibn Wahb told us that Ibn Lahimah informed us from Abu al-Aswad from \u2018Urwah from \u2018Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be Upon Him) said: \"There is no breast-feeding except what fills the stomach to bursting point.\" (Reported by Ibn Maajah, no. 1946; see also Saheeh al-Jaami\u2018, no. 7495). Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: \"The chapter of the one who says there is no breast-feeding after two years because of the words of Allah \u2018... two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling...\u2019 [al-Baqarah 2:233].\" The definition of rad\u2018ah (one breast-feed) is that the child should take the breast and drink milk from it, then leave it of his own accord in order to breathe or to change position, and so on. If this is the case, then the rulings concerning breast-feeding will apply, i.e. the child will be considered a relative and marriage will be forbidden, etc. In the case of doubt concerning the number of breast-feedings, Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"If there is some doubt concerning whether breast-feeding took place, or concerning the number of feeds and whether it was enough to make the child a relative (mahram) or not, then there is no proof that the child must be considered a relative, because the general rule of life is that a child does not breast-feed from anyone except his own mother, and one cannot dismiss certainty in favour of doubt. (al-Mughni 11/312). Therefore it is permissible to marry if there is no proof of breast-feeding that would make the individual concerned a relative. I do not want to omit reminding the one who asked this question that we are obliged to adhere to the Sharee\u2018ah no matter where it leads us, and our desires and emotions should not prevent us from following the truth. The Muslim must remain chaste and avoid all kinds of \"love relationships.\" He must strive to protect himself by marrying in a proper fashion according to Islamic sharee\u2018ah.",
        "summary": "In order for a child's breast-feed to have the desired effect on making a relative, one must first meet two conditions: The number of feeds should be 5 or more; and the amount of time it takes to make a relative is determined by the Hadith of al-Qudaamah. If this cannot be met, then marriages will be forbidden. Lastly, there must be sufficient evidence to prove that a child is a relative before marriage can take place.",

Your question may be answered by the following points: (1) This is the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever changes his religion, kill him.\" (reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3017). (2) The one who has known the religion which Allaah revealed, entered it and practised it, then rejected it, despised it and left it, is a person who does not deserve to live on the earth of Allaah and eat from the provision of Allaah. (3) By leaving Islaam, the apostate opens the way for everyone who wants to leave the faith, thus spreading apostasy and encouraging it. (4) The apostate is not to be killed without warning. Even though his crime is so great, he is given a last chance, a respite of three days in which to repent. If he repents, he will be left alone; if he does not repent, then he will be killed. (5) If the punishment for murder and espionage (also known as high treason) is death, then what should be the punishment for the one who disbelieves in the Lord of mankind and despises and rejects His religion? Is espionage or shedding blood worse than leaving the religion of the Lord of mankind and rejecting it? (6) None of those who bleat about personal freedom and freedom of belief would put up with a neighbour\u2019s child hitting their child or justify this as \"personal freedom,\" so how can they justify leaving the true religion and rejecting the sharee\u2019ah which Allaah revealed to teach mankind about His unity and bring justice and fairness to all?

A marriage contract is valid in Islam if the following conditions are met, even if the marriage does not take place in a court, or in the presence of a Judge or the Imaam of the masjid.

        "question": "Salam Brother, My question is; how does one purify himself or his place of business from things that may have occurred prior to knowledge that it was haram? For example, I own clothing stores, but have financed this business via moneys borrowed and paid interest upon. To this day I am using a bank where I have a loan and pay interest on it. Also in the past I had a business that did not succeed, and was forced into bankruptcy, which meant that there were many people and businesses that were left unpaid, what is my Islamic duty in that case? I did make a sincere effort to pay all that I could but after the business went bad was not able to repay them.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is wajib that you repent for each loan involving interest you took. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed all involved in the interest, the recipient, the sponsor, and the one eating and the feeding it, as stated in the authentic hadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"The gold for the gold, the silver for the silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, date for date, salt for salt, similar for the like, and hand in hand. So whoever adds or seeks to add, then he has used riba. The recipient and the giver of the transaction are the same\". (Reported by Muslim, #1584.) On the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) \"cursed the one who consumes interest, the one giving it, the one bearing scroll, and the two witnesses to it\". He said (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \"they are all equal.\" (Muslim narrated it.) If a Muslim wants to partake in a specific affair and he doesn't know it's ruling, then it is upon him to ask before he gets involved in it. Ignorance isn't an excuse for each and every situation. As far as the loans you borrowed, you are obligated to return the initial money borrowed only. If you are forced to pay riba, and that is the added amount with no way out, then we hope that you do your best in repenting to Allah to pardon you. We also hope that you remain consistent in your business and give sadaqa with what you are able to, in order to purify yourself and your wealth. We ask Allah to enrich us with His halal and to avoid His haram.",
        "summary": "we learn that each and every loan involved interest was converted to riba. In other words, if you borrowed money, you're obligated to return it only if you pay back the original amount you borrowed. If you owe riba, then there's no way out. It's just a matter of asking before you commit.",

Ya\u2019eesh ibn Tihfah al-Ghifaari reported that his father said: \u201cI stayed as a guest with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with those of the poor whom he hosted. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out in the night to check up on his guests, and saw me lying on my stomach. He prodded me with his foot and said, \u2018Do not lie in this manner, for it is a way of lying that Allaah hates.\u2019\u201d According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prodded him with his foot and woke him up, and said, \u201cDo not lie like this, for this is how the people of Hell lie.\u201d (Reported by Ahmad, al-Fath al-Rabbaani, 14/244-245; by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2798, Shaakir edn.; and by Abu Dawood, al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Adab, no. 5040, al-Da\u2019aas edn. Also reported in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 2270-2271) This is a general prohibition that applies to both males and females, because the basic principle is that rulings apply to both sexes, except in cases where it is indicated that there is a differentiation between the two.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due to Allah Drinking coffee is a custom and not from the laws of Islam. If drinking coffee in excess becomes dangerous to the individual, then Islam prohibits it. There are no ceremonies in Islam for coffee drinking nor is drinking coffee from the particular customs of the Muslims, since Muslims as well as non-Muslims drink coffee. There are however specific manners in the Islamic law concerning drinking in general. From amongst them are the following: Drinking with the right hand. To say Bismillah before you begin to drink. Drinking at least three sips or more and not drinking the entire drink at once. To praise Allah after finishing the drink. To drink sitting down. The person giving the drink to others should drink last. The person passing out the drinks should start on his right hand side when distributing the drinks. An individual should not drink from the pitcher, but instead pour some of the drink into a dish or cup, and then drink. A person should not drink from gold or silver dishes. Your question dear young man and the information you provided indicates that you are without a religion and this is wrong because the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that you were born as a Muslim and that this is your origin as well as others besides you. This is the case, until something happened to you to change that, such as other incorrect religions like Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, or Magianism.

Also what does \"or Allah make some way for them\" mean? Thank you for you time, I look forward to your response so that I may better understand Islam through the explanation of Muslims as opposed to those of non-Muslims.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Allah says: \"If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.\" [al-Nisa\u2019 4:15] Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer (explanation) of this aayah: \"At the beginning of Islam, the ruling concerning a woman who was proven guilty of adultery was that she was to be detained in a house and not allowed to come out until she died. So the phrase \u2018If any of your women are guilty of lewdness\u2019 refers to adultery. \u2018Take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way\u2019 - the \u2018other way\u2019 that Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn \u2018Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: \u2018This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was abrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.\u2019 Something similar was reported from \u2018Ikrimah, Sa\u2018id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, \u2018Ataa\u2019 al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn Aslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: \u2018Muhammad ibn Ja\u2018far told us that Sa\u2018id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan ibn \u2018Abdullah al-Raqaashi from \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy (revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on him and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he said: \" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.\"\u2019 It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from al-Hasan from al-Hattan from \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: \u2018Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those (women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.\u2019 Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth.\" Al-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: \"This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam. Ibn \u2018Abbas and al-Hasan said: Ibn Zayd added: They would not be allowed to marry, until they died, as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else. This ruling applied for a while, then the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by \u2018Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: \"Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those (women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.\" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there with the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for confinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. To complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next aayah in Surat al-Nisaa\u2019: \"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful.\" [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:16] Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah: \"\u2018If two men among you are guilty of lewdness\u2019 means two who commit an immoral act, so they should be punished. Ibn \u2018Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa\u2018eed ibn Jubayr and others said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the ruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. \u2018Ikrimah, \u2018Ataa\u2019, al-Hasan and \u2018Abdullah ibn Katheer said: \u2018This was revealed concerning a man and a woman who commit adultery. The phrase \u2018if they repent and amend\u2019 means if they give up what they were doing and mend their ways. \u2018Leave them alone\u2019 means not to keep rebuking them with ugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never sinned at all. \u2018Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful\u2019 - it was proven in the two Saheehs: \u2018If the slave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not blame her (after that)\u2019 - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been given, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.\u2019\"",

        "question": "What do you believe about angels regarding their function, appearance, form and powers?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of faith without which there is no faith. Whoever does not believe in any of these pillars is not a believer (mumin). These pillars are belief in: Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and that predestination, both good and bad, comes from Allah. Who are the Angels? Angels are a part of the world of the \u201cUnseen\u201d which we cannot comprehend. Allah has told us about them in many places in the Quran and via His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There follows a number of proven reports concerning the angels, which hopefully will make you realize the greatness of the Creator and the greatness of this religion which has told us so much about them: Of what are the Angels created? They are created from light, as \u2018Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018The angels are created from light, just as the jinn are created from smokeless fire and mankind is created from what you have been told about.\u2019\" [Muslim]. When were the Angels created? We have no knowledge of precisely when they were created, because there is no text to tell us this. But they were created before mankind for certain, because the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Behold, your Lord said to the angels: \u2018I will create a vicegerent on earth.\u2019\" [2:30] The fact that Allah told them of His intention to create man indicates that they already existed. The great size of Angels Allah says concerning the angels of Hell: \"O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern and severe, who flinch not (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded.\" [66:6] The greatest of all the angels is Jibreel, upon whom be peace, who was described in the following report: \"From \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Jibreel in his true form. He had six hundred wings, each of which covered the horizon. There fell from his wings jewels, pearls and rubies, only Allah knows about them.\" It was reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, and Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidayah that its isnad (chain of narrators) is jayyid (good). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing Jibreel: \"I saw Jibreel descending from heaven, and his great size filled the space between heaven and earth.\" [Muslim]. Among the greatest angels are those who carry the Throne (of Allah), who were described in the following report: \"From Jabir ibn \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: \u2018I have been given permission to speak about one of the angels of Allah who carry the Throne. The distance between his ear-lobes and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.\u2019\" [Abu Dawood]. Description of Angels Angels have wings Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs) adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things.\" [35:1] Beauty of the Angels Allah said, describing Jibreel, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning): \"He [the Prophet] has been taught by one Mighty in Power, Dhoo Mirrah (free from any defect in body and mind), then he rose and became stable.\" [53:5-6] Ibn \u2018Abbas said: \"\u2018Dhoo Mirrah means that he has a beautiful appearance.\" Qutadah said: \"He is tall and beautiful.\" The idea that angels are beautiful is firmly established in all people\u2019s minds, so much so that they liken a beautiful human to an angel, as the women said about Yoosuf: \"... When they [the women] saw him, they did extol him and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said: \u2018Allah preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none other than a noble angel!\u2019\" [12:31] The differences in size and status of the Angels The Angels are not all of one size or status; there are differences between them just as there are differences in virtue. The best of them are those that were present at the battle of Badr, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by Mu\u2018adh ibn Rifa\u2018ah al-Zuraqi from his father, who had been one of the people present at Badr. He said: \"Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and asked, \u2018How do you rate the people among you who were present at Badr?\u2019 He said: \u2018They are the best of the Muslims,\u2019 or something similar. [Jibreel] said: \u2018So it is with the angels who were present at Badr.\u2019\" [al-Bukhaari]. The Angels do not eat or drink This is indicated by the conversation between Ibrahim, the \"friend\" of Allah, and the angels who visited him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf, and placed it before them. He said, \u2018Will you not eat?\u2019 (When they did not eat), he conceived a fear of them. They said: \u2018Fear not,\u2019 and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.\" [51:26-28] Elsewhere, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"But when he [Ibrahim] saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: \u2018Fear not: we have been sent against the people of Lut.\u2019\" [11:70] The Angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and worshipping Allah Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever slacken.\" [21:20] \"... For in the presence of your Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never become tired (nor feel themselves above it).\" [41:38] Number of Angels The angels are many, and their number is known only to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Much-Frequented House (al-Bayt al-M\u2019amoor) in the seventh heaven: \"Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.\" [al-Bukhaari]. \u2018Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018Hell will be brought forth that day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand angels.\" [Muslim]. Names of Angels The angels have names, but we know only the names of a few of them. We have to believe in the names reported in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) texts, as a part of general belief in the angels. Among the names of angels that are known to us are: (1) Jibreel and (2) Mikail \"Say: Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah\u2019s will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings to those who believe - Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and prophets, to Jibreel and Mikail - Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject faith.\" [2:97-98] (3) Israfil From Abu Salamah ibn \u2018Abd al-Rahman ibn \u2018Awf, who said: \"I asked \u2018Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to start his prayer with when he got up to pray at night (qiyam al-layl). She said: \u2018When he got up to pray at night, he would start his prayer (with the words): \u2018O Allah, Lord of Jibreel, Mikail and Israfil, Creator of heaven and earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You are the Judge of the matters in which Your slaves differ; guide me with regard to disputed matters of truth by Your permission, for You guide whomever You will to the straight path.\u2019\" [Muslim]. (4) Malik He is the Keeper of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"They [the people in Hell] will cry: \u2018O Malik! Would that your Lord put an end to us!\u2019\" [43:77] (5) Munkar and (6) Nakeer From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, \u2018What did you used to say about this man?\u2019 and he says what he used to say: \u2018He is the slave and Messenger of Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah. They say, \u2018We knew beforehand that you used to say this.\u2019 Then his grave will be widened for him to a size of seventy cubits by seventy cubits and it will be illuminated for him. Then they tell him, \u2018Sleep.\u2019 He says, \u2018Go back to my family and tell them.\u2019 They tell him, \u2018Sleep like a bridegroom whom no-one will wake up except his most beloved,\u2019 until Allah raises him up. If (the deceased) was a hypocrite, he says, \u2018I heard the people saying something so I said something similar; I do not know.\u2019 They say: \u2018We knew beforehand that you used to say this.\u2019 The earth will be told to squeeze him, so he will be crushed until his ribs are interlocked, and he will remain like that until Allah raises him up.\u2019\" [al-Tirmidhi]. (7) Haroot and (8) Maroot Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Haroot and Maroot...\" [2:102] \"... and none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is nothing other than a warning to mankind.\" [74:31] Power of Angels The angels have great powers given to them by Allah, including the following: The ability to take on different forms. Allah has given the angels the ability to take on forms other than their own. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam in the form of a man, as Allah says: \"... Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.\" [19:17] Angels also came to Ibrahim in human form, and he did not know that they were angels until they told him so. Similarly, angels came to Lut in the form of young men with beautiful faces. Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) in different forms: sometimes he would appear in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a sahaabee (companion) who was very handsome, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin. The sahaabah (companions) saw him in his human form, as is reported from \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the two Saheehs Al-Bukhari and Muslim). (\u2018Umar) said: \"One day while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of travel were to be seen on him, and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said: \u2018O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.\u2019...\" [ Muslim]. Many other ahadeeth (report) refer to the angels taking human forms, such as the hadeeth (report) about the one who killed a hundred, in which it says \"... there came to them an angel in human form...\" and the hadeeth about the blind man, the bald man and the leper. Speed of Angels The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of light; the angels are able to travel much faster than this. Hardly had an enquirer completed a question to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Jibreel would bring the answer from Allah. Duties of Angels Among the angels is one whose task it was to convey the revelation from Allah to His Messengers; this is al-Rooh al-Ameen, Jibreel, upon whom be peace. Allah says: \"Say: whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah\u2019s will... \" [2:97] \"Which the trustworthy spirit has brought down, Upon your heart, that you may be (one) of the warners.\" [26:193-194] Another is responsible for rain, directing it wherever Allah wishes. This is Mikail, upon whom be peace. He has helpers, who do what he tells them, by the command of his Lord; they direct the winds and clouds, as Allah wills. Another is responsible for blowing the Trumpet, which will be blown by Israfil at the onset of the Hour (the Day of Judgement). Others are responsible for taking people\u2019s souls: these are the Angel of Death and his helpers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Say: \u2018the Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls, then shall you be brought back to your Lord.\u2019\" [32:11] There is no proof in any saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) that his name is \u2018Azrail. Others are responsible for protecting the slave throughout his life, when he stays home and when he travels, when he is asleep and when he is awake. These are the \"angels in succession\" concerning whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allah. Verily! Allah will not change the good condition of a people so long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sin and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allah wills a people\u2019s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.\" [13:10-11] Others are responsible for recording the deeds of man, good and bad. These are the \"honourable scribes\" (kiraman katibeen) and are referred to in the ayat/verses (interpretation of the meanings): \"... and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of one\u2019s good and bad deeds) over you...\" [6:61] \"Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes, We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record.\" [43:80] \"(Remember!) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being after he or she has attained the age of puberty), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions). Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).\" [50:17-18] \"But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, Kiraman (honourable) katibeen - writing down (your deeds).\" [82:10-11] Others are responsible for testing people in the grave. These are Munkar and Nakeer. From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, \u2018What did you used to say about this man?\u2019...\" [The hadeeth is quoted in full above] Some of them are the keepers of Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: Salamun \u2018alaikum (peace be upon you!). You have done well, so enter here, to abide therein.\" [39:73] Some of them are the keepers of Hell, the \"guards of Hell\", whose number is nineteen and whose leader is Malik, upon whom be peace. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. And its keepers will say, \u2018Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\u2019 They will say: \u2018Yes, but the word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!\u2019\" [39:71] \"Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers), We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!\" [96:17-18] \"And what will make you know exactly what Hell-fire is? It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburnt)! Burning the skins! Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell). And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire, and We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers - in order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in faith...\" [74:27-31] \"And they will cry: \u2018O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us.\u2019 He will say: \u2018Verily you shall abide forever.\u2019\" [43:77] One of the angels is responsible for the sperm in the womb, as is mentioned in the hadeeth (report) of Ibn Mas\u2018ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose truthfulness is confirmed, said: \u2018The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in his mother\u2019s womb for forty days as a sperm drop, and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot, and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into (the foetus), and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Hell, so he will enter Hell; and one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he will enter Paradise.\" [al-Bukhaari, Muslim]. Some angels carry the Throne of Allah, as He describes in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah) (saying): \u2018Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!\u2019\" [40:7] Some of the angels travel throughout the world, seeking out gatherings of dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \u2018Allah, be He blessed and exalted, has angels who travel the highways seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out to one another, \"Come to what you hunger for!\" and they enfold them with their wings, stretching up to the lowest heaven. Their Lord asks them, and He knows better than them, \"What are My slaves saying?\" They say: \"They are glorifying, magnifying, praising and extolling You.\" He asks, \"Have they seen Me?\" They say, \"No, by Allah, they have not seen You.\" He asks, \"And how would it be if they saw Me?\" They say, \"They would be even more fervent and devoted in their praise and worship.\" He asks, \"What are they asking me for?\" They say, \"They ask You for Paradise.\" He asks, \"And have they seen it?\" They say, \"No, by Allah, O Lord, they have not seen it.\" He asks, \"And how would it be if they saw it?\" They say: \"They would be even more eager for it and they would beseech You even more earnestly.\" He asks, \"And what do they seek My protection from?\" They say, \"From the Fire of Hell.\" He asks, \"Have they seen it?\" They say, \"No, by Allah, they have not seen it.\" He asks, \"And how would it be if they saw it?\" They say: \"They would be even more afraid and anxious to escape it.\" Allah says: \"You are My witnesses that I have forgiven them.\" One of the angels says: \"So-and-so is not really one of them; he came (to the gathering) for some other reason.\" Allah says, \"They were all in the gathering, and one of them will not be excluded (from forgiveness).\"\" [al-Bukhaari]. Some of them are responsible for the mountains. \u2018Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"Have you ever faced any day more difficult than the day of Uhud?\" He said: \"I suffered at the hands of your people and the worst that I suffered was what I suffered at their hands on the day of \u2018Aqabah. That was when I went to call Ibn \u2018Abd Yalayl ibn \u2018Abd al-Kalal to Islam, and he did not respond. I left, feeling depressed and hardly knowing where I was going. I did not recover until I found myself in Qarn al-Tha\u2018alib. I raised my head and saw that I was being shaded by a cloud. I looked, and saw Jibreel in the cloud. He called me and said: \u2018Allah has heard what your people said and how they responded to you. He has sent the Angel of the Mountains so that you can tell him to do to them whatever you want.\u2019 The Angel of the Mountains called me and greeted me, then said: \u2018O Muhammad, tell me what you want me to do. If you want, I can crush them between two mountains. \u2019\"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"All I hope for is that Allah will bring forth from their loins people who will worship Allah alone and not associate any partner with Him.\" [al-Buhaari]. Some of them visit the Much Frequented House (al-bayt al-m\u2019amoor). In the lengthy hadeeth describing the Isra and M\u2019iraj (the Night Journey and the Ascent to Heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.\" There are also angels standing in rows, who never get tired or sit down, and others who bow or prostrate, and never raise their heads, as was reported by Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. The heaven makes a noise like groaning, and it has the right to (or it is no surprise), for there is no space in it the width of four fingers, but there is an angel there, placing his forehead in sujood (prostration) to Allah. By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much, you would not enjoy your relationships with women and you would go out in the street praying to Allah.\u2019\" [ al-Tirmidhi] This is a summary of Islamic teachings concerning the noble angels of Allah. We ask Allah to make us believe in them and love them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

        "summary": "The Prophet and his companions discuss the creation of the seven-frequented House, which is situated in the sixth heaven of the earth. According to the Prophet, this house contains seventy thousand ropes that will eventually be used to transport seventy thousand men to Hell.

        "question": "For some reason a woman tore her hymen. Is it permissible for her to have it repaired surgically?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. This matter is one of the issues that have been raised in the modern age, so we should look at each of the two scholarly opinions on the matter and indicate which one we believe to be more correct. The first opinion is that it is not permissible to repair the hymen at all. The second opinion is more detailed: 1.If the rupture of the hymen was caused by an accident or by an action that is not considered in sharee\u2019ah to be a sin, and was not caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, then we look at the following issue: If it is deemed most likely that the girl will suffer hardship and unfair accusations because of the customs and traditions of her society, then doing this operation is obligatory. If that is not the case, then it is still better to do the operation. 2.If the rupture was caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, as in the case of woman who has been divorced, or by zinaa (illicit sexual activity i.e., outside the bounds of marriage) in a case that is well known among the people, then it is haraam to do this operation. 3.If the rupture was caused by zinaa in a case that is not well known among the people, then the doctor has the choice of either repairing it or not repairing it, although it is better to repair it. The points on which the scholars differ The differences between these two opinions are confined to the first and third cases outlined above. With regard to the second case, they are agreed that this operation in haraam in such situations. Evidence (daleel) The evidence for the first view (that it is completely haraam). Firstly: repairing the hymen could lead to mixing of lineages, as a woman could become pregnant from a previous liaison, then she gets marriaed after having her hymen repaired, which then leads to the pregnancy being attributed to her husband, thus mixing halaal with haraam. Secondly: repairing the hymen involves looking at that part of the \u2018awrah which is to hidden most. Thirdly: repairing the hymen makes iteasy for young women to commit the sin of zinaa, because they know that they can have the hymen repaired afterwards. Fourthly: there is the matter of good and bad consequences, or pros and cons. If it is possible to achieve the good consequences whilst warding off the bad consequences, then we should do that. If the bad consequences outweigh the good consequences, we should ward off the bad consequences and not worry about the good consequences, as the fuqahaa\u2019 of Islam have stated. If we apply this principle and look at the evil consequences that result from repairing the hymen, we will understand that it is not permissible to do this operation because of the enormity of the evil consequences that result from it. Fifthly: one of the principles of Islamic sharee\u2019ah is that something harmful cannot be removed by something else that is also harmful. One of the implications of this principle is that \u201cit is not permissible for a man to prevent his land from being flooded by diverting the flood waters onto someone else\u2019s land.\u201d By the same token, it is not permissible for a girl and her mother to remove harm from themselves by having the hymen repaired and thus causing harm to the husband. Sixthly: the basic idea of repairing the hymen is not permissible according to sharee\u2019ah because it is a kind of deceit, and deceit is forbidden in Islam. Seventhly: repairing the hymen pavest he way for girls and their families to tell lies about the real reason why the hymen was ruptured, and lying is also forbidden in Islam. Eighthly: repairing the hymen paves the way for doctors to resort to performing abortions for the purposes of concealing sin. Evidence for the second opinion: Firstly: the texts indicate that it is permissible and is encouraged to conceal sins, and repairing the hymen helps to achieve that in cases where this operation is permissible. Secondly: if a woman who is innocent of any immoral action is allowed to have this operation so as to leave no room for suspicion, this will ward off unjustice for her and will achieve the aim prescribed by sharee\u2019ah of thinking well of believing men and women. Thirdly: repairing the hymen has to ward off harm. If a woman was left without having this operation done, and her husband were to notice that, it would cause trouble for her and her family, and if the matter became well known among people, the family may never be able to find marriage partners for their daughters. So they are permitted to ward off harm because they are innocent in this case. Fourthly: the fact that a Muslim doctor may perform this operation in order to conceal the illusionary evidence of has a general educational impact on society, especially where the psychology of young women is concerned. Fifthly: the objection of deception does not exist in cases where we have determined that it is permissible to repair the hymen. Which view is more correct? The view which is more correct- and Allaah knows best \u2013 is that which states that it is not permissible to repair the hymen at all. This is for the following reasons: Fisrtly: because the reports quoted as evidence by those who have this view are saheeh. Secondly: with regard to the evidence quoted by those who favour the second view, they may be dealt with as follows: The response to the first : The concealing that is required in Islam is that described in the texts as a concealing of sin, but this aim is not achieved by repairing the hymen. Basically it is haraam because it involves uncovering the \u2018awrah and opens the door to evil. The response to the second : Preventing the husband from thinking badly of the woman may be achieved by informing him of the situation before marriage. If he accepts it, this is fine, otherwise Allaah will compensate her with someone better. The response to the third : The evil consequence mentioned cannot be avoided entirely by doing this operation, because there is the possibility that the husband may find out about it, even if that happens by way of someone else telling him. He should be told about it, and if he accepts then the evil consequence is not longer an issue, as is also the case if he decides not to go ahead with the marriage. The response to the fourth : Even though there are some positive aspects to this concealment, there are also negative consequences, such as making it easy for women to commit zinaa. Warding off evil consequences takes priority over gaining benefits. The response to the fifth : We do not accept that there is no deception involved, because this hymen is renewed, it is not the original hymen. If we accept that there is no deception of the husband involved in cases where the hymen was broken as a result of jumping and so on, we cannot be sure that there is no deception in cases where it was broken as a result of an attack on the woman. Secondly: blocking the routes that could lead to harm, as mentioned by those who favour the first opinion, is a very important matter, especially in cases that have to do with the violation of the sanctity of private parts and the evil that can undoubtedly result from permitting the repair of hymens. Thirdly: the basic principle in Islam is that it is haraam to uncover, touch or look at that which is \u2018awrah. The excuses mentioned by those who favour the second opinion are not strong enough to let operations to repair the hymen be exempted from this general rule. So we have to adhere to this ruling, and say that it is haraam to do operations to repair the hymen. Fifthly [sic]: the evil consequence of false accusations being made can be dealt with by obtaining a medical certificate after the event to prove the woman\u2019s innocence. This is the best way, and by doing this there is no longer any need to do an operation to repair the hymen. For all of these reasons, it is not permissible for a doctor or a woman to do this kind of surgery, and Allaah knows best. (See Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah wa\u2019l-Athaar al-Mutarattibah \u2018alayhaa by Dr. Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti, p. 403) Some contemporary scholars have issued fatwas stating that surgery to repair the hymen is permissible in the case of rape victims and those who have repented (from zinaa), but it not permissible in the case of women who have not repented, because this is helping her to continue committing that sin. By the same token, a woman who has previously had intercourse is not permitted to do this operation because this is helping her to deceive and cheat a future husband, since he will think that she is a virgin when this is not the case. And Allaah knows best",
        "summary": "The scholars debate whether or not it is legal for a doctor to repair hymen. Some scholars support the operation, while others oppose it. The scholars argue that it is against the doctrine of sharee'ah because there are so many wrongs to befallen in a married woman's life. However, they do agree on one thing: it is not legally possible to repair these hymen after all.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam When a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage, a number of things are recommended in the sunnah: He should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: \u201cI prepared \u2018Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: \u2018Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).\u2019 So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, \u2018Give some to your companion (meaning himself).\u2019\u201d (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani) He should place his hand on his bride\u2019s head and pray for her, saying \u201cBismillah\u201d and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhen one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: \u2018Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha \u2018alayhi wa a\u2019udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha \u2018alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).\u2019\u201d Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa\u2019id added: \u201cThen let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.\u201d (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami\u2019 al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami\u2019, no. 341) He should pray two rak\u2019ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa\u2019id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: \u201cWhen your wife comes in to you, pray two rak\u2019ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.\u201d (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: \u201cA man called Abu Hariz came and said (to \u2018Abdullah ibn Mas\u2019ud, may Allah be pleased with him): \u2018I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.\u2019 \u2018Abdullah said: \u2018Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak\u2019ahs behind you.\u2019\u201d (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani). When he wants to consummate the marriage, he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: \u201cWhen one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: \u2018Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)\u2019 \u2013 then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91) Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast? There is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride\u2019s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite. Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram? It is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music, letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? At weddings, women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present. Who should give the wedding walimah? Providing the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband\u2019s responsibility. The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to \u2018Abd al-Rahman ibn \u2018Awf, \u201cGive a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048). We ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "The sunnah recommends that a Muslim treats his bride kindly, like offering him something to drink. He should also treat his bride gently and ask for barakahs, which is the custom of the Salaf; he should also pray for her health and keep an eye on her if she needs any assistance. In addition, he should not allow alcohol in the wedding ceremony because it is forbidden in Islam for people to drink alcohol unless they are accompanied by a companion. Finally, there are no limits on how many guests one can have at a wedding feast: only those who wish to eat the wedding feast will be allowed.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al hamdulilah As soon as you have come to know, dear noble inquirer, that Islam is the true religion of righteousness and the straight path, you should hasten to embrace it and begin practicing the Islamically-prescribed obligations, such as the prayer, etc. Your earning to learn about Islam is a wonderful thing for which you should be commended.

For example there are several pages on the Internet that you can use to gain knowledge and benefit. You can also correspond to the various Islamic organizations and publishing houses to get valuable and informative books about Islam. There may be an Islamic center in your town or in a nearby town that you can go to, even if only once a month, to get to know your fellow Muslim sisters and to get advice from them and work with each other in enjoining righteousness and good deeds. Perhaps you can use the internet as an avenue to find out the addresses of Islamic centers in any particular city or state. If it is possible for you to move to a city where there is a Muslim community or an Islamic center which adheres to true, mainstream Islam (followers of the Sunnah and the united Islamic community), this would be very good. If, in the worst case, may Allaah forbid, lets suppose you don't find even a single Muslim about you, this would not ever prevent you from holding fast to the religion of Islam. In Islam you have an ever-persistent relationship with your Lord; you worship Him and talk to Him and ask Him guidance, support, and aid in adhering to His religion; you feel His company and security by your prayers to Him your seeking refuge in Him--to an extent that will compensate you more than the absence of anybody else, and will allay your loneliness and the inability to meet fellow sisters in faith and religion. Consider the situation of the followers of our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) who embraced Islam at its inception. They remained alone and estranged among their tribes and people, each one worshipping Allaah from his place until the Prophet migrated to al-Madinah, at which time they migrated with him and supported him in establishing the Islamic state. We ask Allaah for your guidance and for you to reply quickly to the call of Allaah and his Prophet (peace be upon him), and we wish you happiness in this life and the hereafter.",
        "summary": "You should be able to embrace Islam and begin practicing its religiously prescribed obligations. In fact, learning about Islam will help you to become a better person and to follow the teachings of the Prophet. It will also make you feel closer to your Lord and improve your loneliness and inability to find fellow sisters-in-waiting in the world of Islam. As long as you are faithful to the tenets of Islam, then there's no reason why you can't continue to hold fast to the faith. In addition, if you're an adherent of the strict, mainstream version of Islam, then you won't be lonely or lonely. You'll just need to stick with it.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. If yellowish or brownish secretions and red blood spots appear regularly before and after your period then they are considered part of your period so long as the total number of days does not exceed 15 days. Consequently, you cannot pray nor fast during this time. Yet if your period actually stops and the secretions appear after 1 or more days after your period has ended then these secretions are not considered part of the menstruation. In which case you can fast and pray, as you are considered in a state of istihaadah not menstruation, but you will need to perform ablution for each prayer, after the athaan (prayer call) or corresponding time has come. See questions #56 and #57.",
        "summary": "If you have a period that lasts 15 days, then it's not considered as part of your menstruation. However, if you have secretions or red blood spots in the middle of your period and they don't seem to be part of the period at all, then there's no reason why you should fast and pray while your period is still going on. In other words, you shouldn't worry too much about these secretions because they're just regular periods.",

        "question": "I have a question in the area of what is and isn't Bidaa. Over and over again I hear people terming certain actions as Bidaa. I am however confused. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there a hadith by Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that says that anyone who introduces a new helpful hadith will be rewarded. If this is true, then why are all new inovations frowned upon.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Firstly, we should know what \"bid'ah\" means according to Islamic teaching. It is defined as: any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allaah. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Qur'aan or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator]. If your confusion has to do with an apparent contradiction between the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah and the hadeeth narrated by Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, then let us examine these two reports and find out what they mean: Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing and is followed by others, will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in any way. Whoever starts a bad thing and is followed by others, will bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their burden in any way.'\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2675. He said, This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth) There is a story behind this hadeeth, which will explain what \"whoever starts a good thing\" means. Imaam Muslim reported this story from Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, who also narrated the hadeeth itself. He said: \"Some people from the Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), wearing woollen garments. He saw that they were in bad shape and in desperate need, so he urged the people to give them charity. They people were very slow to respond, and it could be seen in his face (that he was upset). Then a man of the Ansaar brought a package of silver, then another came, and another and another, and his face was filled with joy. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts a bad thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a burden of sin like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden.'\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1017) Further explanation may be found in a report recorded by al-Nisaa'i, also from Jareer ibn 'Abdullah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"We were with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) early one day, when some people who were almost naked (not dressed properly) and barefoot, with their swords by their sides, came to him. Most, if not all of them, were of (the tribe of) Mudar. The Messenger's face changed when he saw how poor they were (i.e., he became upset). He went into (his house), then he came out and ordered Bilaal to give the call to prayer. He led the people in prayer, then he addressed them, saying: 'O people, \"be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both he created many men and women, and fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)\" [al-Nisaa' 4:1]. \"Fear Allaah, and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow\" [al-Hashr 59:18]. Let a man give charity from his dinars, his dirhams, his clothing, his wheat or his dates - even if it is only half a date.' A man from the Ansaar brought a package which he could hardly carry in his hand, then another and another came, until there were two piles, of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) beaming with joy. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward, and whoever starts a bad thing in Islam will have to bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Mujtaba: Kitaab al-Zakaat, Bab al-Tahreed 'ala al-Sadaqah). From the context of the story, it is clear that what is meant by the words \"whoever starts a good thing (sunnah hasanah) in Islam\" means: Whoever revives a part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or teaches it to others, or commands others to follow it, or acts according to it so that others see him or hear about it and follow his example. This is also indicated by the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he urged the people to give him charity. A man said: 'I have such-and-such,' and there was no person left in the gathering who did not give something in charity to him, whether it was a large amount or a little. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts something good, and others follow his lead, will have a complete reward and a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts something bad, and others follow his lead, will bear a complete burden of sin, and a burden like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by Ibn Maaajah in al-Sunan, no. 204) It should be clear from the above, with no room for doubt, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not allowing innovation in matters of deen (religion), nor was he opening the door to what some people call \"bid'ah hasanah,\" for the following reasons: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated repeatedly that: \"Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire.\" (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, when beginning a khutbah (sermon): \" The best of speech is the Book of Allaah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going astray\" (reported by Muslim, no. 867) If every bid'ah is a going astray, how can some people then say that there is such a thing in Islam as \"bid'ah hasanah\"? By Allaah, this is an obvious contradiction of the statement and warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that whoever innovates something new in the deen (religion) will have his deed rejected, and Allaah will not accept it, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not a part of it will have it rejected.'\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, no. 2697). How can anybody then say that bid'ah is acceptable and it is permitted to follow it? When a person innovates something and adds to the deen something that does not belong to it, he is implying a number of bad things, each worse than the last, for example: That the religion is lacking, that Allaah did not complete and perfect it, and that there is room for improvement. This clearly contradicts the statement in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): \" This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion\" [al-Maa'idah 5:3] That the religion remained imperfect from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the time when this innovator came along and completed it with his own ideas. That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \"guilty\" of either of two things: either he was ignorant of this \"good innovation,\" or he knew about it but concealed it, thus letting his ummah down by not conveying it. That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), his Companions and the righteous salaf (early generations) missed out on the reward of this \"good innovation\" - until this innovator came along and earned it for himself, despite the fact that he should say to himself, \"If it was truly good, they would have been the first to do it.\" Opening the door to bid'ah leads to changing the deen (religion) and opens the way for personal whims and opinions, because every innovator implies that what he is introducing is something good, so whose opinion are we supposed to follow, and which of them should we take as a leader? Following bid'ah leads to the cancelling out of sunnah practices and the ways of the salaf. Real life bears witness that whenever a bid'ah is followed, a sunnah practice dies out; the reverse is also true. We ask Allaah to save us from the misguidance of personal whims and from all trials whether they are open or secret. And Allaah knows best.",

In this case, it refers to any invented method in religion that seeks to draw people closer to Allaah and thereby drawing them away from their own prejudices and beliefs.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Seven of those whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His were mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth. It was reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere are seven whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allaah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says \u2018I fear Allaah\u2019; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allaah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up.\u201d (Agreed upon, narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 620; Muslim, no. 1712; and others). This is one of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon His believing slaves. On the great Day when mankind will be suffering distress and hardship,the sun will be brought near to mankind, until the distance between them is equal to the length of the stick used for applying kohl to the eyes [meel= may also mean a \u201cmile\u201d], and all the people will sweat according to their deeds, except for some of the believers, whom Allaah will single out to shade them with His shade, and He will protect them from the sun and from sweating. \u2018Uqbah ibn \u2018Aamir said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \u201cThe sun will be brought near to the earth and the people will sweat. For some people, the sweat will come up to their heels; for some it will come halfway up their shins; for some it will come up to their knees; for some it will come up to their backsides; for some it will come up to their hips; for some it will come up to their shoulders; for some it will come up to their necks; for some it will come up to the middle of their mouths; and some of them will be comepletely covered with their sweat.\u201d (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, no. 16798) There follows the commentary of Ibn Hajar (may Allaah be pleased with him) on the hadeeth (about the shade of Allaah): \u201cwith His shade\u201d. The fact that the shade is connected to Allaah is an expression of honour, for every shade belongs to Him. It was said that this refers to His honour and protection, just as it may be said (in Arabic) that a person is in the shade (or shadow) of the king. And it was said that it refers to the shadow of His Throne, which is more correct \u201cthe just ruler\u201d means one who holds the position of khaleefah, and anyone else who is appointed to a position of authority over the Muslims\u2019 affairs, and he fulfils his duties justly. The best definition of \u201cjust\u201d is: one who obeys the commands of Allaah and puts everything in its proper place without going to the extreme either of overdoing it or of negligence. The just ruler is mentioned first because his benefits are so far-reaching. \u201ca young man\u201d. Young men are mentioned in particular because they are more likely to feel desire because of their strong motives for following their desires. The fact that a young man adheres to worship despite that is indicative of the strength of his taqwaa (piety). \u201cworshipping his Lord\u201d. In the hadeeth of Salmaan it says that he \u201cspent his youth and his energy in worshipping Allaah.\u201d \u201cattached to the mosque\u201d. The apparent meaning is attachment in the sense of hanging, as if his heart is likened to something that hangs in the mosque \u2013 like a lamp, for example \u2013 indicating that his heart is so strongly attached to the mosque that even when he leaves the mosque, his heart is still there. Or it could mean attachment in the sense of a deep love. \u201clove one another\u201d means, they shared a kind of love whereby each loved the other in a genuine sense, not just to show off. \u201cand [they] meet and part on that basis\u201d means, this is an ongoing love based on religion, which they do not cut off for any worldly reason, whether they meet in reality or not, until death comes between them. \u201ca man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty\u201d. The meaning of \u201cof rank\u201d is, of high birth or a high position; this may refer to lineage or to wealth. The woman is described as having all the qualities which people usually seek, power and wealth, along with beauty. It is very rare to find all three in a woman. The apparent meaning is that she called him to commit immoral actions. \u201cand says \u2018I fear Allaah\u2019\u201d. The apparent meaning is that he says this out loud, either to rebuke her for her immoralityor to refuse her call. It may also be that he says it in his heart. \u201cto such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives\u201d. What is meant by this is that he conceals his charitable giving, and goes to such an extreme that his left hand, even though it is so close to his right hand and is always with it that even if we imagined that it could understand, it would not know what the right hand is doing because of this utter secrecy. This is a metaphor. \u201cand a man who remembers Allaah\u201d \u2013 either in his heart, or by mentioning Him out loud. \u201cwhen he is alone\u201d \u2013 because this is furthest away from showing off. What is meant here is that there are no distractions, so he pays attention to nothing except Allaah. \u201chis eyes fill up (lit. flood)\u201d means, they fill with tears; this is another metaphor. Although men are mentioned in this hadeeth, women are also included in what is described here. Although what is meant by a \u201cjust leader\u201d is the position of imaam (khaleefah), women may also be included in this, if they have children and treat them justly. The idea of being attached to the mosque does not apply to women, because a woman\u2019s prayer in her home is better than her prayer in the mosque. Apart from that, women have a share in all of these things; if a man may be called by a woman, then it can be imagined that a woman could be called by a handsome king, for example, and she refuses because she fears Allaah, even though she may have motives to respond. Fath al-Baari, 620. There are others whom Allaah will also shade with His shade \u2013 apart from the seven mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above \u2013 who are mentioned in other ahaadeeth. Ibn Hajar listed them in Fath al-Baari (620) as follows: \u201cThose who fight (for the sake of Allaah); those who help the mujaahideen; those who defer payment of debt for debtors who are in difficulty, or let them off all or part of the debt; those who help people who are heavily in debt; those who help slaves who have drawn up contracts of manumission; those who have a good attitude; those who walk to the mosque; sincere and honest traders; those who take what is due to them and no more; those who spend for the sake of Allaah; those who sponsor orphans.\u201d We ask Allaah to shade us with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His.",

        "question": "IF THE MAN IS NOT THE MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IS HE CONSIDERED AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Qiwaamah (the role of being in charge or head of the household) is one of the things that Allaah has given to men, exclusive of women. What is meant by qiwaamah is that men are entrusted with the task of being responsible for women, to take care of them, to guide them in the best possible way, and to issue commands and prohibitions - just as a ruler takes care of the people under his control. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"...but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [women]...\" [al-Baqarah 2:228] and \"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means...\" [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:34] Ibn Katheer said: \"This means that men are in charge of women; they govern them and discipline them if they do wrong.\" Al-\u2018Allaamah Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said: \"This indicates that men are better than women, because the masculine is honour and perfection, whereas the feminine naturally has something lacking physically. All people are agreed on this, because all peoples give women the best of adornments, which is only to make up for this natural lack...\" Rare cases among women are nothing to go by, because the exception does not change the rule. Some of the reasons why men are given the role of qiwaamah include: 1. Men are more intelligent and have a better ability to distinguish right from wrong. Al-Qurtubi said: \"Men have the advantage of being more wise and more capable of management; for this reason they were given the right of qiwaamah.\" 2. Men\u2019s religion is more complete, because women menstruate and bleed after childbirth, and do not pray or fast at such times - unlike men. 3. Spending money in charity and on one\u2019s family is a duty on men, but not on women. Thus if a man refuses to spend on his wife, she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage by going to a Qaadi (Sharee\u2019ah judge). In summary, qiwaamah is only for men, as is made clear in the Qur\u2019aan. If a woman spends on her husband, herself and her children, this is an act of kindness on her part, as Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it (the mahr) to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).\" [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:4] Qiwaamah is for men in all cases: one can hardly imagine a man asking his wife for permission to go out, for example. And Allaah knows best. For more information on this matter, please refer to: Ibn al-\u2018Arabi, Ahkaam al-Qur\u2019aan, 1/531; Ahkaam al-Jassaas, 2/188; Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 2/169; Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/491; al-Shanqeeti, Adwaa\u2019 al-Bayaan, 1/136-137)",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. In this brief section, the narrator explains that he has been given the title of \"Qiwaamaah,\" or head of household, by the Allaah. The title refers to a person who is able to distinguish between right and wrong. It also refers to the position of \"qiwaamah\", which is to be used in order to distinguish wrong from good. The narrator uses quotes from various sources, including al-Hasan, al-Ahmad, Al-Khattab, Ahrar al-Shakheer, and al-Rumayee. All these sources give different reasons for why men should be allowed to serve in the role of \"qiwaamsah\". For example, if a man spends money on his wife but does not spend on her family, she may have the right to appeal to aSharee'ah judge. If a man stops spending money on himself and his family, he may seek annulment because it would be an offence to do so.",

        "question": "What is the ruling of the Ulama with chicken slaughtered by Muslims but were stunned (given mild electric shock to weaken the chicken) before slaughtering?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah., It is prohibited to stun the animals by stroking or using electricity for these kinds of stunning hurt the animal and the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) interdicts us from torturing or hurting animals and on the contrary ordered us to be kind and benevolent with them especially at slaughtering. Imam Ahmad narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) passed by a group from Al-Ansar (the supporters) while they were aiming at a pigeon. The Prophet said: \"Don\u2019t make an aim from an alive creature\". Saeed Ibn-Gobair narrated that Ibn-Ommar had passed by some youth from Koraish while they were aiming at a bird and in return for their missed shoots they gave the owner of the bird the arrows. When the youth saw Ibn-Ommar, they ran away so Ibn-Ommar said: \"Who did that? Allah curses the one who did that. The prophet (Peace be upon Him) curses any one who takes an alive creature as an aim\".Narrated by Muslim # 3619 Imam Muslim narrated on the authority of Ibn-Gaber Ibn-Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Prophet \"forbids us from leaving animals tied without food or drinks until death\" (No. 3620) Also, Imam Muslim narrated that Shadad Ibn-Aws said: \"I have kept in heart two points from our Prophet (Peace be upon Him). Allah orders us to refine every thing we do. When killing enemies, kill properly, and when slaughtering animals slaughter properly. So the one in change of slaughtering must sharpen his blade to comfort his slaughtered animal. There are many other evidences that prove the importance of being kind and benevolent with animals. In short, it is unlawful to stun the animal before slaughtering because stunning hurts the animal and Allah forbids us from doing that except in necessary when the animal is out of control at slaughtering and it is difficult to catch it so it is then lawful to resort to partial stunning to control the animal and in turn it would be lawful to be eaten if it is slaughtered alive. This stunning is permitted only if it doesn\u2019t lead to death of the animal for if that happened it would be unlawful to be eaten as Allah the Almighty said in His Holy Book: \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah, that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a head long fall, or by being gored to death, that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal, unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due from), that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrow: that is impiety.\" (Al-Maidah # 3) And Allah knows best, and Peace & Blessing be upon His Messenger Mohammed and his companions.",
        "summary": "The final chapter of the book deals with the slaughter of animals. It is against the law to stun or use electricity to control an animal, but it is also against the will of God to eat an animal alive. The final chapter does not address the question of whether or not wild animals are allowed to be eaten or devoured.",

        "question": "Can a muslim celebrate a non muslim holiday like Thanksgiving?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Greeting the kuffaar on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is haraam, by consensus, as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah: \"Congratulating the kuffaar on the rituals that belong only to them is haraam by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying \u2018A happy festival to you\u2019 or \u2018May you enjoy your festival,\u2019 and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from kufr, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realize the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or bid\u2019ah or kufr exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah.\" Congratulating the kuffaar on their religious festivals is haraam to the extent described by Ibn al-Qayyim because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of kufr, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not aceept the rituals of kufr or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allaah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"If you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you...\" [al-Zumar 39:7] \"... This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion...\" [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:3] So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are one\u2019s colleagues at work or otherwise. If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allaah. These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islaam, with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:85] It is haraam for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations. Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the kuffaar by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts, or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc., because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\" Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Iqtidaa\u2019 al-siraat al-mustaqeem mukhaalifat ashaab al-jaheem: \"Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak.\" Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islaam, and because it makes the kuffaar feel proud of their religion. Allaah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent. Majmoo\u2019ah Fataawa wa Rasaa\u2019il al-Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymeen, 3/369)",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. As for congratulating people on their festivals, fasts, or feasts, according to consensus, it is not haraam. But the same thing can be said of congratulating anyone else for their disobedience or bid'ah-or kufr, which is a sin. Congratulating someone for defying Allaah's will is also a sin, as it implies that you accept or approve of their rituals and practices, even if you would not accept them for yourself. The same could be said about congratulating someone who abstains from his or her religion. In other words, everyone should refrain from congratulating anybody else for what they have done wrong. It is just as bad as congratulating an offender for drinking wine or murdering someone. And speaking of apologies, I repeat: \"It is as great/As great/Sale as congratulates someone for stabbing someone.\"",

        "question": "Will a person who loves Allah enter Hell? There are many non-Muslims such as Jews and Christians who love Allah, and similarly there are immoral Muslims who love Allah. They would never say that they hate their Lord. Can you clarify this matter?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding this matter: There are four kinds of love, which we must differentiate between, and those who go astray do so because they do not make this distinction. The first of them is love of Allah, but this alone is not sufficient to save a person from the punishment of Allah and to earn him His reward. The Mushrikeen (idolaters), worshippers of the cross, Jews and others all love Allah. The second is love of that which Allah loves. This is what brings a person into Islam and out of disbelief. The most beloved of people to Allah is the one who is most correct and most devoted in this kind of love. The third kind is love for the sake of Allah, which is one of the essentials of loving that which Allah loves. A person\u2019s love of that which Allah loves cannot be complete until he also loves for the sake of Allah. The fourth is love for something alongside Allah, and this love has to do with shirk (paganism). Everyone who loves things alongside Allah but not for the sake of Allah has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the love of the Mushrikeen (pagan). There remains a fifth kind of love which has nothing to do with our topic; this is the natural love which is a person\u2019s inclination towards that which suits his nature, such as the love of a thirsty person for water or of a hungry person for food, or the love of sleep, or of one\u2019s wife and children. There is nothing wrong with this unless it distracts a person from remembering Allah and keeps him from loving Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): \u201cO you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah\u201d [63:9] \u201cMen whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah\u201d [24:37] (Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, 1/134) And he said (may Allah have mercy on him): The difference between loving for the sake of Allah and loving something alongside Allah is one of the most important distinctions. Everyone needs to make this distinction and is indeed obliged to do so. Loving for the sake of Allah is a sign of the perfection of faith, but loving something alongside Allah is the essence of shirk (paganism). The difference between them is that a person\u2019s love for the sake of Allah is connected to his love of Allah; if this love becomes strong in his heart, this love dictates that he will love that which Allah loves. If he loves that which his Lord loves and he loves those who are the friends of Allah, this is love for the sake of Allah. So he loves His Messengers, Prophets, angels and close friends because Allah loves them, and he hates those who hate them because Allah hates those people. The sign of the love and hatred for the sake of Allah is that his hatred for the one whom Allah hates will not turn into love merely because that person treats him kindly, does him a service or meets some need he has; and his love for those whom Allah loves will not turn to hatred simply because that person does something that upsets or hurts him, whether it is done by mistake or deliberately, in obedience to Allah or because the person feels that he has a duty to do it for some reason, or because the person is a wrongdoer who may yet give up his wrongdoing and repent. The entire religion revolves around four principles: love and hatred, and stemming from them, action and abstinence. The person whose love and hatred, action and abstinence, are all for the sake of Allah, has perfected his faith so that when he loves, he loves for the sake of Allah, when he hates, he hates for the sake of Allah, when he does something, he does it for the sake of Allah, and when he abstains from something, he abstains for the sake of Allah. To the extent that he is lacking in these four categories, he is lacking in faith and commitment to religion. This is in contrast to the love of things alongside Allah, which is of two types. One is diametrically opposed to the principle of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah) and is shirk; the other is opposed to perfection of sincerity and love towards Allah, but does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam. The first kind is like the love of the Mushrikeen for their idols and gods. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah\u201d [2:165] These Mushrikeen love their idols and gods alongside Allah as they love Allah. This love and devotion is accompanied by fear, hope, worship and supplication. This love is pure Shirk which Allah does not forgive. Faith cannot be perfected unless a person regards these idols as enemies and hates them intensely, and hates the people who worship them, and regards them as enemies and strives against them. This is the message with which Allah sent all His Messengers and revealed all His Books. He created Hell for the people of shirk who love these rivals, and He created Paradise for those who strive against them and take them as enemies for His sake and to earn His Pleasure. Anybody who worships anything from the vicinity of the Throne to the lowest depths of the earth and takes a god and a supporter besides Allah and associates other beings in worship with Him, will be disowned by the object of his worship when he is most in need of it [i.e., on the Day of Judgement]. The second kind is love for the things which Allah has made attractive to people, such as women, children, gold, silver, branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. People love them with a kind of desire, like the love of the hungry person for food and the thirsty person for water. This love is of three kinds. If a person loves them for the sake of Allah and as a means of obeying Allah, he will be rewarded for that; it will be counted as a part of love for the sake of Allah and a means of reaching Him, and he will still find enjoyment in them. This is how the best of creation [i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] was, to whom women and perfume were made dear in this world, and his love for them helped him to love Allah more and to convey His Message and fulfil His commands. If a person loves them because they suit his nature and his own desires, but he does not give them preference over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and he gets them because of his natural inclination, then they come under the heading of things which are permissible, and he will not be punished for that, but his love of Allah and for the sake of Allah will be lacking somewhat. If his sole purpose in life is to get these things, and he gives priority to that over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, then he is wronging himself and following his own desires. The first is the love of al-Saabiqoon (those who are foremost in Islam); the second is the love of al-muqtasidoon (those who are average) and the third is the love of al-zaalimoon (the wrongdoers). Al-Rooh by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/254. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "summary": "The prophet further explains that there are four types of love. He says that a person who goes astray because he does not distinguish between the first two kinds of love and the natural love, which is love for Allah. The natural love is a person's inclination towards something alongside him or her, but this cannot be complete unless he also loves it. This is why people go astray; they do not understand the concept of shirk. In addition, there remains a fifth type of love: love for the \"presence of Allah,\" which is the essential of loving what Allah loves. The prophet further emphasizes the importance of adhering to the ideals of the religion in order to convey his message and fulfil his mission.",

        "question": "What is \u2018Aqeedah? I kindly request you to explain this to me.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.What is \u2018Aqeedah? \u2018Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one\u2019s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty. The Arabic word \u2018aqeedah stems from the root \u2018aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bima \u2018aqqadtum al-ayman)...\" [al-Maidah 5:89] The verb paraphrased here as \"deliberate oaths\" is \u2018aqqada/ta\u2019qeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, \u2018aqada\u2019l-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. The word i\u2019tiqad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong. The phrase a\u2019taqadtu kadhaa (I believe such and such) means: I am convinced of it in my heart; this is a rational conviction. In Islam, \u2018aqeedah is the matter of knowledge. The Muslim must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts or misgivings, because Allah has told him about \u2018aqeedah in His Book and via His Revelations to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Principles of \u2018Aqeedah The principles of \u2018aqeedah are those which Allah has commanded us to believe in, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \"The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. They say, \u2018We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers\u2019 \u2013 and they say, \u2018We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).\u2019\" [al-Baqarah 2:285] - and as defined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous hadeeth which describes how Jibreel came to him and asked him about Islam etc.: \"Iman (faith) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him on the Last Day, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection.\" So in Islam, \u2018aqeedah refers to the matters which are known from the Quran and sound ahadeeth, and which the Muslim must believe in his heart, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allaah and His Messenger. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. What is Aqeedah? The Arabic word \"aqeedah\" means \"belief and conviction.\" In Islam, the concept of knowledge is based on the belief that one's actions will be judged according to what he or she believes in, whether they are intentional or deliberate oaths. If an oath is unintentional, then God will not punish it for unintentional oaths; He will punish him for making strong. In other words, if an oath has unintentional effects, then there will be no punishment for that. In contrast, in the holy book of al-Qur'an, the doctrine of alchemy, which focuses on the concepts of certainty, veracity, confirmation etc., is based upon the root 'aqada,' which conveys meaning of determination. Thus, when one makes a deliberate oath, he will be punished for his deliberate oath--he will punish those who deliberate swears because Allah has already told him about this. Principles of Aqedah The principles described above refer to matters which have been passed down from the Prophet to the believers. They do not make distinction between one person and another. Each person must believe in their own self-belief, without any doubts or worries.",

Is it permissible for one to think badly of the Prophet\u2019s wife \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, when anything said about \u2018Aa\u2019ishah is from authentic hadeeeths, such as Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. \u2018Aa\u2019ishah and the other Mothers of the Believers are included among the Companions of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), so every text that forbids slandering the Companions refers to \u2018Aa\u2019ishah too. Abu Sa\u2018eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \u2018Do not slander my Companions, for if one of you were to spend an amount of gold equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud, you would not even come halfway up to their level.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3379). Moreover, the scholars of Sunni Islam are all agreed that whoever condemns \u2018Aa\u2019ishah for that of which Allaah has stated she is innocent is a kaafir, because he has rejected Allaah\u2019s statement of her innocence in Soorat al-Noor. Imaam Ibn Hazm quoted a report with an isnad going back to Hishaam ibn \u2018Ammaar, who said: \"I heard Maalik ibn Anas say: \u2018Whoever curses Abu Bakr should be whipped, and whoever curses \u2018Aa\u2019ishah should be killed.\u2019 He was asked, \u2018Why do you say that concerning (the one who curses) \u2018Aa\u2019ishah?\u2019 He said, \u2018Because Allaah says concerning \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, may Allah be pleased with her (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.\" [al-Noor 24:17]\u2019\" Maalik said: \"Whoever accuses her goes against the Qur\u2019aan, and whoever goes against the Qur\u2019aan should be killed.\" Ibn Hazm said: \"This comment of Maalik\u2019s is correct, and it is complete apostasy to reject Allaah\u2019s words that clearly state her innocence.\" Abu Bakr ibn al-\u2018Arabi said: \"Because the people who slandered \u2018Aa\u2019ishah accused a pure and innocent person of immorality, then Allah exonerated her. So everyone who accuses her of that of which Allah has stated she is innocent is rejecting what Allah says, and everyone who rejects what Allah says is a kaafir. This is the opinion of Maalik, and the matter is very clear to those who have insight.\" Al-Qaadi Abu Ya\u2018laa said: \"Whoever slanders \u2018Aa\u2019ishah by accusing her of that of which Allah stated her innocence is a kaafir, without doubt. More than one imam stated this ijmaa\u2018 (consensus) and gave this ruling.\" Ibn Abi Moosaa said: \"Whoever accuses \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, of that of which Allaah stated she was innocent has left the religion (is no longer a Muslim) and has no right to marry a Muslim woman.\" Ibn Qudaamah said: \"It is a part of the Sunnah to say \u2018May Allah be pleased with her\u2019 after mentioning the wives of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), Mothers of the Believers who are pure and innocent of any evil. The best of them are Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid and \u2018Aa\u2019ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, whose innocence was stated by Allah; (they are) the wives of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) in this world and the next. Whoever accuses her of that of which Allah has stated her innocence has rejected the words of Allaah All-Mighty.\" Imam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"\u2018Aa\u2019ishah\u2019s innocence of that of which she was accused is stated definitively in the Qur\u2019aan. If anyone doubts that (may Allah protect us from such a thing), he becomes a kaafir and an apostate, by the consensus of the Muslims.\" Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"The ummah is agreed that whoever slanders her is a kaafir.\" Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer said, in his Tafseer: \" The scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, all agreed that whoever accuses or slanders her after the revelation of this aayah is a kaafir, because he has rejected the Qur\u2019aan.\" Badr al-Deen al-Zirkashi said: \"Whoever slanders her is a kaafir, because the Qur\u2019aan clearly states her innocence.\" The scholars based their ruling on the one who slanders \u2018Aa\u2019ishah on the following evidence: (1) The evidence that is derived from the verses in Soorat al-Noor that clearly state her innocence. So whoever accuses her after Allah has declared her innocent is rejecting the words of Allah, which is kufr beyond any shadow of a doubt. (2) Slandering the family of the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) hurts and offends the Prophet himself, and there is no doubt that whatever hurts and offends the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) is kufr, by consensus (ijmaa\u2018). Evidence that the slander of his wife hurt and offended the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) is seen in the hadeeth of the slander (al-ifk) reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, in which \u2018Aa\u2019ishah says: \"... The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) stood up on that day and asked who would go and deal with \u2018Abdullaah ibn Ubayy. He was on the minbar, and said: \u2018O Muslims, who will deal with a man who I have heard is speaking in an offensive manner about my family? By Allaah, I know nothing but good about my family.\u2019...\" What the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) meant was: who will be kind to me, and excuse me if I go and deal with him myself, and I give him what he deserves because I have heard that he is speaking in an offensive manner about my family. This proves that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was so deeply offended and hurt that he asked people whether they could deal with this person fairly. Imaam al-Qurtubi said, in his Tafseer of the aayah \"Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.\" [al-Noor 24:17]\": \"This is concerning \u2018Aa\u2019ishah... because of the hurt and offence that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) felt with regard to his honour and his family. This is kufr on the part of the one who does it.\" (3) Slandering \u2018Aa\u2019ishah implies insulting the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women)... \" [al-Noor 24:26] Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"I.e., Allah would not have made \u2018Aa\u2019ishah the wife of the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) if she had not been good, because he is better than any good person. If she had been bad, she would not have been fit to marry him from a shar\u2018i point of view, and Allah would never even have decreed it..\" Finally, let us remember that the most beloved of all people to him (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was \u2018Aa\u2019ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, as is proven in the report of \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018Aas, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) put me in charge of an army during the ghazwah (campaign) of al-Salaasil. I came to him and asked him, \u2018O Messenger of Allaah, who among the people is most beloved to you?\u2019 He said, \u2018Aa\u2019ishah.\u2019 I asked, \u2018Who among men?\u2019 He said, \u2018Her father.\u2019 I asked, \u2018Then who?\u2019 He said, \u2018\u2018Umar,\u2019 then he mentioned a number of others.\" So whoever feels hatred towards the beloved of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) will deserved to be despised by him on the Day of Resurrection.

In such a case it is not permissible to donate blood, because this will help them to fight Muslims.

He wants to go to Mecca (Makkah) to make a pilgrimage in the near future, but he has a big injury on his foot, and needs to use a crutch. Can he go to Makkah? Or can people who are not healthy not make the pilgrimage?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says in His Holy Book: \u201c... Hajj to the House [Ka\u2018bah] is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one\u2019s conveyance, provision and residence]; and whoever disbelieves, then Allaah stands not in need of any of the \u2018Aalameen [mankind and jinn].\u201d [Aal \u2018Imraan 3:97] The scholars\u2019 discussion of the ability to perform Hajj revolves around the availability of a means of transport and sufficient money for the journey there and back, as well as sufficient funds to cover one\u2019s family\u2019s needs during one\u2019s absence, freedom from debt, good health, security on the way, and - for women - a mahram (blood relative within the prohibited degrees of marriage, or a husband). The issue of your Muslim friend revolves around the question of health, so we will focus on this matter here: With regard to the interpretation of the aayah (verse of the Qur\u2019aan) quoted above, \u2018Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u201cSabeel [paraphrased in the phrase \u2018those who can afford the expenses\u2019] means health.\u201d (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). One of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that a person should be free of physical illness and disability that would prevent him from performing Hajj. If a person is suffering from a chronic illness, permanent disability, paralysis (that makes him unable to walk) or is very old and unable to move about, then there is no obligation to perform Hajj. If a person is able to perform Hajj with the help of another, then it becomes a duty to perform Hajj when such help is available. (al-Mawsoo\u2018ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 17/34). Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \u201cThere may be different categories of ability. Sometimes a person may be able to perform Hajj by himself, and sometimes with the help of others, as is stated in the books of Ahkaam (Islamic rulings).\u201d (Tafseer of the aayah previously quoted). Whoever suffers from a permanent disability that prevents him from performing Hajj must appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. If his disability is not permanent, then he should wait until he has recovered, then perform Hajj for himself; he is not permitted to appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. This is the answer to your question, which I hope you will convey to your friend. I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your concern and interest in finding out the Islamic rulings in this situation which has to do with the fifth pillar of Islam. I also wish to encourage and invite you to join us in Islam. Peace be with you.",

If he or she suffers from a chronic disease, permanent illness, paralysis, or other disabling conditions that prevent him from undertaking Hajj, then there must be someone else who can perform the Hajj on behalf of him. For example, if he has a serious illness or a permanent disability but does not have to wait until he recovers or when such someone is available, then he/she should hire someone else to perform the feat.

May Allah (s.w.t) bless you. Thank you.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Praying four rakahs after Jumuah prayer is the opinion of some Madhhabs, and has nothing to do with staying in Makkah or far away, or being in an Islaamic country or not, or whether or not there is a khaleefah. The existence or permission of a khaleefah is not a condition for Friday prayers being obligatory or valid, according to Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 8/187) Having dealt with what you have heard from people who have no knowledge, but who are unfortunately in the position of \"imaams,\" as you said, we move on to the basic issue of offering salaat al-dhuhr after salaat al-jumuah. Our answer to this question is that the truth is the opinion of the scholars, most of whom say that there is no basis in shareeah for offering dhuhr prayer after jumuah prayer if a person has prayed jumuah. The one who misses jumuah or does not attend it because it is not an obligation for him or her, such as women, sick people or travellers, must pray dhuhr. It was never reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his Companions prayed dhuhr after praying jumuah. If he had done so, there would be reports to that effect. We ask Allaah to give you and us help and strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "question": "Is ruling with rules other than sharee\u2018ah \u201ckufr akbar\u201d or \u201ckufr asghar\u201d?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to refer matters to His judgement and to establish Sharee\u2018ah, and He has forbidden us to rule with anything else, as is clear from a number of aayaat in the Qur\u2019aan, such as the aayaat in Soorat al-Maa\u2019idah (5) which discuss ruling according to what Allaah has revealed, and mention the following topics: The command to rule according to what Allaah has revealed: \u201cAnd so judge between them by what Allaah has revealed...\u201d [aayah 49] Warning against ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed: \u201c... and follow not their vain desires...\u201d [aayah 49] Warning against compromising on any detail of Sharee\u2018ah, no matter how small: \u201c... but beware of them lest they turn you far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you...\u201d [aayah 49] Forbidding seeking the ruling of jaahiliyyah, as is expressed in the rhetorical question \u201cDo they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance?\u201d [aayah 50] The statement that nobody is better than Allaah to judge: \u201c... and who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?\u201d [aayah 50] The statement that whoever does not judge according to what Allaah revealed is a kaafir, a zaalim (oppressor or wrongdoer) and a faasiq (sinner), as Allaah says: \u201c... And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.\u201d [aayah 44]; \u201c... And whoever does not judge by that which Allaah has revealed, such are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)\u201d [aayah 45]; \u201c... And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed (then) such (people) are the faasiqoon (rebellious or disobedient).\u201d [aayah 47]. The statement that it is obligatory for the Muslims to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, even if those who seek their judgement are not Muslim, as Allaah says: \u201c... And if you judge, judge with justice between them...\u201d [aayah 42] Judging or ruling according to other than what Allaah has revealed is contrary to faith and Tawheed, which are Allaah\u2019s rights. It may be counted as kufr akbar (greater kufr) or kufr asghar (lesser kufr) according to circumstances. Kufr akbar will make a person no longer a Muslim in cases such as the following: If he issues laws and regulations other than those revealed by Allaah, because the right to issue laws belongs to Allaah alone, Who has no partner, and whoever \u201ccompetes\u201d with Him in a matter which is His alone is a mushrik, because Allaah says: \u201cOr have they partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed?\u201d [al-Shooraa 42:21] If the one who rules by other than that which Allaah has revealed denies the right of Allaah and His Prophet to rule, as is mentioned in Ibn \u2018Abbaas\u2019s comment on the aayah:\u201c... And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:44]. Ibn \u2018Abbaas said: \u201cWhoever rejects what Allaah has revealed is a kaafir.\u201d If he prefers the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is in absolute terms or just in a few matters. Allaah says: \u201cDo they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:50] If he regards the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal. Allaah says: \u201c... Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:22] If he thinks that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts the rule of Allaah and His Messenger, or he believes that it is not obligatory to rule according to what Allaah has revealed, or that the matter is optional. This is kufr which is contradictory to faith. Allaah revealed: \u201cO Messenger! Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you, of such who say: \u2018We believe\u2019 with their mouths but their hearts have no faith. And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to others who have not come to you; they say, \u2018If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!\u2019...\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:41]. He says: \u201cGo to Muhammad (peace be upon him), and if he tells you that the ruling is lashes, accept it, but if he commands stoning, ignore what he says. Then Allaah revealed \u201c... And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon (disbelievers)\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:44]. If he does not rule according to what Allah has revealed out of stubbornness and arrogance, he is a kaafir and has left Islaam, even if he does not deny the rule of Allaah. Stubbornness and arrogance may mean negligence and turning away, as Allaah says: \u201cHave you seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot (false judges, etc.) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shaytaan wishes to lead them astray. And when it is said to them: \u2018Come to what Allaah has sent down and to the Messenger,\u2019 see they hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad) with aversion.\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:60-61] Among the things that may be counted as ruling by other than that which Allaah revealed and kufr akbar is what Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem said about man-made laws and ruling by them: \u201cThis is the worst, the most obvious and comprehensive opposition to sharee\u2018ah and rejection of Allaah\u2019s laws. This is competing with Allaah and His Messenger, contradicting His laws in their preparation, support, structure, ruling and references. The above is a summary of the things that may imply that ruling by other than that which Allah has revealed is a form of shirk akbar (major shirk): (1) Ruling by other than that which Allaah has revealed. (2) Denying the right of Allaah and His Messenger to rule. (3) Preferring the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is complete or only in a few matters. (4) Regarding the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal. (5) Thinking that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts what Allaah has revealed, or believing that ruling by what Allaah has revealed is not obligatory or is optional. (6) Refusing to rule by what Allaah has revealed. By examining this topic from different angels, it becomes clear that what is counted as kufr akbar is the following: Abolishing sharee\u2018ah as the law governing a country, as Mustafa Kemal (\u201cAtaturk\u201d) did in Turkey, as he abolished the book Majallah al-Ahkaam al-\u2018Adliyyah which was based on the Hanafi madhhab, and replaced it with man-made laws. Abolishing sharee\u2018ah courts. Imposing man-made laws, such as Italian, French, German law, etc., to judge between the people, or mixing these laws and Sharee\u2018ah, as Genghis Khan did in his book al-Yaasiq, which combined laws from different sources; the \u2018ulamaa\u2019 (scholars) ruled that he was a kaafir. Confining the role of sharee\u2018ah courts to so-called \u201ccivil\u201d matters, such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. Setting up non-sharee\u2018ah courts. Discussing sharee\u2018ah in parliament and voting on it; this indicates that implementing sharee\u2018ah is conditional upon a majority vote. Making sharee\u2018ah a secondary or main source, along with other sources of law. Even when they say that sharee\u2018ah is the primary source of legislation, this is still kufr akbar, because it means that they are allowing the adoption of laws from other sources too. Stating in the clauses of legislation that reference may be made to international law, or stating in treaties that in the case of dispute, the matter may be referred to such-and-such non-Islamic court. Criticizing sharee\u2018ah in public or in private, such as saying that it is rigid, incomplete or backward, or suggesting that it is incompatible with our times, or expressing admiration for non-Islamic laws. As regards the question of when ruling by other than what Allaah revealed is kufr asghar, which does not exclude a person from the ummah of Islam: the answer is that this may be the case when a ruler or judge passes judgement according to other than what Allaah revealed out of disobedience or on a whim, or as a favour to someone, or because he was bribed, and so on, although he believes that it is obligatory to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, and that what he has done is a sinful and haraam deed. As regards the one who is governed by a non-Islamic law, if he refers to it out of choice, then he is a kaafir whose kufr akbar means that he has left Islaam. But if he has no choice but to refer to this law, and does so reluctantly, then he is not a kaafir, because if he had been able to resort to sharee\u2018ah, he would have done so, and he believes that this non-Islamic law is false. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.When is ghusl required? The causes that make ghusl a must are: The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"What requires water (ghusl ) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you.\" (Muslim, no. 1/269) Contact between the genitals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If one part enters the other part (in another report: if one part touches the other part), then ghusl becomes obligatory.\" (Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526) This ghusl is obligatory whether or not fluid (semen) is released. \"Touching\" here refers to the entry of the tip of the penis into the vagina, not mere touching. Menstruation and nifas (post-natal bleeding), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you...\" [al-Baqarah 2:222] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Fatimah bint Hubaysh, may Allah be pleased with her: \"When your period starts, stop praying, and when your period ends, perform ghusl then start praying again.\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, 309) Death: the dead - apart from a martyr slain in battle - must be washed (ghusl), because when his daughter Zaynab died, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Wash her with water three or five times, or as many times as you see fit.\" (Al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1175) When a man who was in a state of ihram was killed by his riding-beast, he said: \"Wash him with water and lote leaves and wrap him in his two garments, but do not embalm him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing the Talbiyah.\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, 1186) There are other types of ghusl about which the scholars differed as to whether they are obligatory, such as performing ghusl on Fridays, or whether a person who becomes Muslim needs to perform ghusl upon entering the Faith. When is ghusl recommended? There are types of ghusl which are encouraged, such as: ghusl on the two \u2018Eids ; ghusl after washing a dead body; ghusl before entering the state of ihram or entering Makkah; ghusl for a woman who is suffering from istihadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding) before every prayer; ghusl after being unconscious; and ghusl after burying a mushrik.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. The fuqahaa are agreed that it is not permitted to keep a dog unless it is for a purpose, like hunting or guarding property or other uses that are not contrary to the Shareeah. The Prophet (peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for herding, hunting or farming, his reward will decrease by one qiraat every day.\" (Reported by Muslim, 2948) As far as keeping a dog to guard the house is concerned, Ibn Qudaamah said: \"It is not permitted, according to the most sound opinion.\" (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/124) For more information on this matter, please see question #377. As regards the najaasah (impurity) of the dog, the Shaafii and Hanbali ulamaa say that the whole dog is essentially naajis (impure). Some scholars say that any liquid excreted by the dog is naajis (not the dog itself). The saliva of the dog is extremely naajis, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away whatever was in it and wash it seven times.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 418). Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The way to purify the vessel of any one of you if a dog has licked it is to wash it seven times, the first time with earth.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 420). We must ensure that Muslims continue to be averse to dogs, even in the midst of what the kuffaar are used to do and what some Muslims have adopted of their habits.

Similarly, if someone keeps a small dog solely for \"herding, hunting\" or \"gathering or farming\", he will not be rewarded every day. In addition, there are some scholars who believe that any liquid used by the dog should be naajis(not the dog's).

Do your duty to Allaah and fear Him. Seek the means of approach to Him [al-Maaidah 5:35] This includes seeking to approach Allaah through His Names and Attributes, or by doing acts of obedience and worship by which one seeks to approach Allaah, and so on. Seeking to approach Allaah by asking His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make dua for one during his lifetime, and the believers asking one another to make duaa for one another. This follows on from the first type and is encouraged. Seeking to approach Allaah by virtue of the status and virtues of some created being, such as saying, O Allaah, I ask You by virtue of Your Prophet and so on. This is allowed by some of the ulama, but this opinion is daeef (weak). The correct view is that it is definitely haraam, because there can be no tawassul in duaa except by virtue of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. Tawassul as it is understood by many of the Muslims of later times, which is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking his help (or seeking the help of the dead and so-called awliya). This is a form of major shirk, because calling on or seeking help from anyone other than Allaah with regard to something that that only Allaah is able to do is a kind of worship, and directing worship to anyone or anything other than Allaah is major shirk. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise for Allah. The aayah interprets the term \"tawssul\" as four things--the kind of belief, the kind of faith that is complete, seeking to approach the Prophet, obeying him and his Messenger, obedience and worship. Seeking to contact the Prophet through his Names and Attributes or by asking his Messenger/Hebrews to make dukassul during his lifetime. This is the type that is encouraged in later times; it calls on the Prophet and asks for the help of dead and dying people. It is a major shirk from the earlier times.",

        "question": "I was raised a Muslim and know what is halaal and what is haraam. At one point in my life I forgot my religion. During that period I committed adultery and the result of that was a child. Now Allaah has blessed me by guiding me back to the true path. Allaah is also making the child\u2019s mother\u2019s heart lean towards Islaam, and in sha Allaah she will become a Muslim.

May Allaah forgive me and all Muslims.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Who has guided you, for you would not be guided if Allah had not guided you. Praise be to Allah Who has brought you back to the Straight Path of Truth. We ask Allah to make you one of those of whom He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance, and bestows on them their piety.\" [Muhammad 47:17] With regard to your first question, we have already answered it on this website. Briefly, it is permissible for you to marry this woman if you both repent to Allaah. The child should be named after its mother, according to the consensus of the scholars. In response to your second question, it is not permissible at all to offer prayers outside their proper time. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... Verily the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times.\" [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:103] \"Then, there has succeeded them a people who have given up the prayer [i.e., have made their prayers to be lost, either by not offering them, or by not offering them perfectly, or by not offering them in their proper, fixed times, etc.] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell.\" [Maryam 19:59] \"So woe to those performers of prayers who delay their prayer from their stated fixed times.\" [al-Maa\u2018oon 107:3-4] It is not necessary to know whether the floor of the office or workplace is clean or not, because the basic rule is that any place is clean unless you come to know otherwise. The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"The earth has been made for me a mosque and a means of purification...\" So choose a suitable spot and pray there at the appropriate times. Beware of delaying your prayers, especially Salaat al-\u2018Asr (the mid-afternoon prayer), because the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"Whoever misses al-\u2018asr, it is as if he lost his family and his wealth.\" (Agreed upon; this version was reported by Muslim, no. 992).

        "question": "Here in my country (Surinam, South America), the Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jama\u2018ah forbid women to go to the mosque, saying that the first Imam (Imam Abu Hanifah) learned to do what pleases the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and he had said once that it is better for the women to perform prayer at home, because there is more reward in that, and as we come here to earn reward, it is better to do this. Is it right to forbid women to go to the mosque? If so, where in the Holy Quran or the hadith can I find this?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque? There is no doubt that a woman\u2019s prayer in her house is better for her than praying in the mosque, as is indicated by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: \"Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila\u2019l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami\u2018, no. 7458) Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"A woman\u2019s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila\u2019l-masjid. See also Sahh al-Jami\u2018, no. 3833). Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa\u2018idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you.\" He said: \"I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque.\" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she met Allah (i.e., until she died). (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy) Can women go to mosques? But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith: From \u2018Abdullah ibn \u2018Umar, who said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: \u2018Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.\u2019\" Bilal ibn \u2018Abdullah said, \"By Allah, we will prevent them.\" (Ibn \u2018Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: \"I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say \u2018By Allah, we will prevent them\u2019!!\" (Reported by Muslim, 667) Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque, as follows: She should wear complete hijab. She should not go out wearing perfume. She should have the permission of her husband. Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. Does a woman pray better than prayer in the house? No. Just as long as she prays at home instead of in her house, then she will be able to do her job. In fact, according to the Hadith, there are no such things as \"praying at home\" and \"praying in your bedroom.\" There are also no such thing as \"poaching in your house\" or \"prayer in your mosque.\" The only thing that can be said about prayer is that it is preferable to praying in the presence of a person who is dead. It is not possible for women to pray at mosques because they are not permitted by the Prophet to go to them.",

        "question": "Is it permissible to hold the Jummah Khutbah in English if the majority of the community does not understand Arabic? Have the scholars agreed on this issue or is there a difference of opinions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Some of the scholars said that it is not permitted to translate the khutbah given from the minbar on Friday and the two Eids into foreign (non-Arabic) languages. Their intention (may Allaah have mercy on them) was to maintain and preserve the Arabic language, and to follow the way of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them), which was to give the khutbah in Arabic in the lands of the Persians and others, and to encourage the people to learn Arabic and pay attention to it. Other scholars said that it is permissible to translate khutbahs into other languages if most of the people being addressed do not know Arabic, based on the reason for which Allaah enjoined the khutbah, which is to teach the people about the rulings that Allaah has prescribed for them and to tell them of the sins which are forbidden, to guide them towards good characteristics and to warn them against bad characteristics. Undoubtedly paying attention to the aims and purposes is more important and takes precedence over paying attention to the words used, especially when the audience does not understand Arabic and the khutbah does not have any effect on them and does not motivate them to learn Arabic. (Especially in these times when the Muslims have fallen behind and others have advanced, and the language of the dominant people has become widespread and the language of the defeated is in a weaker position). If the aim of conveying knowledge and Islamic teaching to the people can only be achieved among non-Arabs by translating the khutbahs into their languages, then the view that it is permissible to translate the khutbah into the prevalent language of the audience so that they may understand what is being said takes precedence and should be followed, especially if not translating the khutbahs will lead to conflicts and arguments. Undoubtedly translating the khutbah in such a case becomes essential to serve the people\u2019s interests and avoid mischief. If there are some people in the congregation who do understand Arabic, then the khateeb should combine the two languages, giving the khutbah in Arabic then repeating it in the other language which the other people understand. In this manner he will achieve the two purposes, avoiding mischief and conflict among the people whom he is addressing. There is a great deal of evidence to support that in the pure sharee\u2019ah, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them.\u201d [Ibraaheem 14:4] And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Zayd ibn Thaabit to learn the language of the Jews so that he might send letters to them in their language and establish proof against them, and so that he might read their letters when they were sent, and explain to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what they said. And when the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) attacked the Romans and Persians, they did not fight them until they had called them to Islam by means of interpreters. When they conquered the foreign countries they called the people to Allaah in Arabic and commanded the people to learn it. Whoever among them did not know Arabic, they called him in his own language and made him understand what was meant in the language that he did understand. Thus proof was established. Undoubtedly this is the only way, especially at the end of time when Islam is like a stranger and every people is clinging to its own language. There is a very real need for translation now, and the daa\u2019iyah cannot convey his message without it. The khateeb should do that which best suits the interests of the people he is addressing. If the best is to give the khutbah part by part, in Arabic and then translated, then he should do that. If the best is to translate the entire khutbah, after giving the khutbah (in Arabic) or after the prayer, then he should do that. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "The scholars disagree with some of the scholars who say that it is proper for the Khateeb to translate the message he is delivering into foreign languages. Some scholars defend the use of the kutbahs, arguing that they are more important than the actual message being delivered. However, others maintain that the purpose of the sermon is to impart knowledge and keep the Arabic language in the hands of the people present. They do not believe that translating the whole message into other languages would lead to conflicts or arguments.",

I never talk back to my mother and i respect her opinions but what can i do and how can I handle situation like this what can I do please helb me. thank you",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Before we find out what the Quraan says about despising others because of their origins, we should know what the Quraan says about having girlfriends. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25] In his commentary on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Muhsanaat [translated as chaste] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zinaa (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musaafihaat, which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them Ibn Abbaas said: muttakhidhaati akhdaan means lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend. Allaah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation Now that you know the Islamic ruling on this matter and are sure that what you have done is haraam and sinful, we will now move on to what Allaah says about despising others for their origins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former [al-Hujuraat 49:11] Allaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished from one another and thus get to know one another. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. is one of the muttaqeen the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. [al-Hujuraat 49:13] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary on this aayah: Here Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from one soul, from which He created its mate this refers to Aadam and Hawwa (Adam and Eve) and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, from such-and-such a tribe. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable? He said: The most honourable in the sight of Allaah are the most pious (those who have most taqwa). They said, That is not what we were asking about. He said: The most honourable of people is Yoosuf the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Friend (khaleel) of Allaah. They said: That is not what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes. He said: The best of you at the time of Jaahiliyyah are the best of you in Islam, if they understand properly. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your deeds. Further information that is relevant to your question may be found under #1805 and #1114.

        "question": "Some people say that Allah is above the heavens (according to one of the verses of the Quran), and may scholars say that Allah exists without a place, since only the creation has the characteristic of needing a place and we know the ayah \"Laysa-ka-mithli-he-shay\" - (proving Allah does not resemble His creation); is He everywhere, existing without a place, or above the heavens?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah., The people of Sunnah and Jama\u2019ah (adherents to the prophetic way) believe that Allah is exalted above His creation because of the evidence of the Quran, Sunnah (prophetic traditions), consensus of the scholars, common sense and man\u2019s innate instinct (fitrah). (1) The Quran describes the \"exaltedness\" or \"highness\" of Allah in different ways, as His being high and above, and by describing how things come down from Him, and go up to Him, and by stating that He is above heaven. For example (interpretations of the meaning): (Highness): \"... and He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" [2:255] \"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.\" [87:1] (Above): \"And He is the Irresistible, above His slaves...\" [6:18] \"They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.\" [16:50] (Things coming down from Him): \"He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth... \" [32:5] \"Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran)...\" [15:9] (Things going up to Him): \"... To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it...\" [35:10] \"The angels and the Rooh (Jibreel) ascend to Him...\" [70:4] (Allah is above heaven): \"Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you...?\" [67:16] (2) The Sunnah: Many reports were narrated \"mutawatir\" (i.e. with a large number of narrators at every stage of the isnad/chain, such that it is impossible for them all to have agreed on a lie) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), describing his words and deeds and things of which he approved. For example, he used to say \"Subhana Rabbi al-A\u2019la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)\" in sujood (prostration), and in some ahadeeth (reports) he is reported to have said \"By Allah Who is above the Throne.\" Among his deeds is the gesture of pointing up with his finger, when addressing the people in the greatest gathering, on the Day of \u2018Arafah during his Farewell Pilgrimage. He asked the people, \"Have I not conveyed the message?\" and they said, \"Yes!\" He asked again, \"Have I not conveyed the message?\" and they said, \"Yes!\" He asked a third time, \u201cHave I not conveyed the message?\" and they said \"Yes!\" Each time, he said: \"O Allah, bear witness!\" - pointing up to the sky and then at the people. He also used to raise his hands towards heaven when he made du\u2019a (supplication), as reported in many ahadeeth. This is proof via his actions that Allah is exalted and high. An example of an approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that Allah is exalted and high is the hadeeth (report) concerning the young slave girl, to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Where is Allah?\" She said: \"In heaven.\" He asked, \"Who am I?\" She said, \"The Messenger of Allah.\" So he said to her master: \"Set her free, for she is a believer.\" This young girl was uneducated, as many are, and she was a slave, but she knew that her Lord is above heaven. Some misguided people deny that Allah is above heaven, and say, \"He is neither above nor below; neither to the right nor to the left. He is everywhere!\" (3) The consensus of the scholars: The salaf (pious predecessors) agreed that Allah is above heaven, as is reported by scholars such as al-Dhahabi, may Allah have mercy on him, in his book Al-\u2018Aluw li\u2019l-\u2018Aliy al-Ghaffar. (4) Common sense: Highness is a quality which is associated in people\u2019s minds with perfection. If this is the case, then it should be attributed to Allah because every absolute perfection should be attributed to Him. (5) The innate instinct of man (fitrah). There should be no dispute that man instinctively knows that Allah is above heaven. Whenever something overwhelming befalls a person, and he turns to Allah for help, he looks towards heaven, not in any other direction. But it is strange that those who deny that Allah is above His creation still raise their hands in supplication to no other direction than towards heaven. Even Pharaoh, the enemy of Allah who disputed with Moosa (peace be upon him) about his Lord, told his minister Haman (interpretation of the meaning): \"O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the god of Moosa...\" [40:36-37] He knew in his heart of hearts that Allah is real, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And they belied them (those ayat/signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof...\" [27:14] These are a few of the indications that Allah is above the heavens; this proof comes from the Quran, the Sunnah, the consensus of the scholars, common sense, man\u2019s own instincts and even the words of the non-Muslims. We ask Allah to guide us towards the Truth. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. The people of the Sufjan al-Adha believe that God is exalted above creation, according to the interpretation given by the Sunnah and the Jama'ah. They also believe that there is a higher quality of heaven than earth, which they attribute to man's innate instinct.",

        "question": "Is it permissible to do masah(wiping) on the socks even if one did not have wudu prior to putting on his socks. Example: It is hard to wash ones feet at their business, because people think we are making a mess.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.First: A Muslim must be proud of his religion and not feel ashamed of its rites and rituals being performed in front of others, or of what shari\u2019ah imposes upon him. If he fears that seeing the implementation of a religious practice or ruling may cause the unbelievers to have an aversion to the religion, then he wisely conceals, aiming at presenting Islam gradually and in an appropriate way. This doesn\u2019t mean to be ashamed or weak or feeling disgrace from implementation of some religious rituals. I suspect you fear from their disapproval because of their misunderstanding, inverted senses, and spoiled opinions, ideas, and inclinations. How could the removal of one\u2019s socks and the washing of one\u2019s feet be considered filthy or disgusting, when the fact that is that it effects cleanliness and the removal of sweat and unpleasant odor from the feet? Second: It is not permissible for the person to pass wet hands over the socks unless he put them on in a state of purity. You can find the evidence in the following Hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah Ibn-Shu\u2019bah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said: \"I was traveling with our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Prophet asked me saying, \"Have you got any water?\" I said, \"Yes\"... and poured out water so that the Prophet washed his face and hands... and his arms then wiped his head. Then I bent over to pull off his khuff (a type of thick sock) but the Prophet said \"Leave them for I put on my khuff in a state of purification\" then he wiped over them. (narrated by Al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari No. # 5353) Ibn Hajar, may Allaah bless him, quoted the following in his explanation of the portion of this Hadith in which the Prophet\u2019s said \"I put them on a state of purification\": Al-Hamidy related in his Musnad that the Prophet was asked whether one could pass wet hands over the khuff, the Prophet answered saying: \"Yes if the person puts them on in a state of purification.\" Ibn Khuzayma said that according to Hadith narrated by Safwan Ibn Assal, \"the Prophet ordered us to wipe over khuff if we put them on in a state of purification, for 3 days during traveling and for one day and night in residency\". Safwan\u2019s hadith, although it is sahih, does not meet the conditions defined by Al-Bukhari. But al-Mughirah\u2019s hadith is in agreement with it in its indication of the stipulation of being in a pure state before putting on the socks. Third: It is in fact easy to solve your problem; all you need to do is perform the complete ablution at home before going to work, washing your feet, then put on your socks. Then, if you want to perform ablution again at work, you can pass your wet fingertips over the back (i.e., top) of each foot. And Allah Knows Best",
        "summary": "This chapter is full of praise from the author. The author emphasizes that a Muslim must respect his religion, not feel ashamed or weak from it. He also points out that some religious rituals may cause unbelievers to become disenchanted with the religion. However, this does not mean that the person should be ashamed of his religion or feel disgraced by any religious ritual. A Muslim should be able to present his religion gradually and in appropriate ways. This doesn't mean that he feels shame from implementing religious rituals; rather, it means that he fears people who do not like the shari'ah, which puts an end to all religious practices. In other words, a Muslim shouldn't fear people who don\u2019t like what they see or hear because they have different opinions, ideas and inclinations than he does. If you fear that someone will disapprove because of how your religion is being implemented, then stop trying to present Islam gradually and accurately.",

        "question": "If a woman's body has been altered so much during her pregnancies that she feels ashamed to show herself in front of her husband, is she allowed to have plastic surgery?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Ruling on performing plastic surgery Your question revolves around the ruling on performing plastic surgery, on which we will give you a brief summary. Doctors who specialize in plastic or cosmetic surgery define it as surgery performed to improve the appearance of part of the body. This may be done by choice, or because it is necessary. Plastic surgery that is considered necessary is that which is done when there is a need for it, when something does not look right, when something is missing, if there is too much or too little of something, or because something has been destroyed or deformed. At the same time, it is regarded as cosmetic surgery because it results in improved appearance. Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery Faults may be of two types: physical or congenital faults and faults which result from illness. Congenital faults include abnormally turned-out lips, hare-lips, twisted fingers or toes, etc. Faults which result from illness include the scars left by leprosy or other skin diseases, or scars caused by accidents and burns. There is no doubt that such faults and scars cause physical and psychological pain and harm, therefore Islam allows people afflicted with them to remove or reduce them by surgical means. They cause the kind of mental and psychological pain that allows this surgery as an urgent need, where necessity permits something that is ordinarily forbidden. Any cosmetic surgery which comes under this heading of need because of the fact that the reason for the surgery is causing harm is permissible, and is not considered to be changing the creation of Allah. Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden To further understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden, we will quote the words of al-Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on the hadith: \u201cAllah has cursed the women who make tattoos and the women who have this done, the women who pluck facial(eyebrow) hair and the women who have this done, and women who widen the gap between their own or others teeth for the sake of beauty, changing what Allah has created.\u201d (Sahih Muslim, 3966) Al-Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThe woman who tattoos is one who uses a needle or similar implements to prick the skin of the hand, wrist, lips or other part of a woman's body until she draws blood, then she puts dye into the wound. It is haram to do this or have it done by choice. Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haram, whether one does it or asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haram to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger. It is haram to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadith, and because it involves changing what Allah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood. Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look beautiful, which indicates that what is haram is when this is done in the pursuit of beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best.\u201d (al-Nawawi, commentary on Sahih Muslim, 13/107) We should point out here that cosmetic surgeons do not distinguish between cases of serious need and other cases. Their concern is to earn money and satisfy their customers. Materialists and proponents of freedom think that man is free and can do whatever he wants with his body, but this is wrong; the body belongs to Allah and He can command whatever He wills concerning it. Allah has told us about the ways in which Iblis (Shaytan) promised to lead people astray, one of which is (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.\u201d [al-Nisa 4:119] Haram cosmetic surgical procedures There are cosmetic surgical procedures which are haram and are not considered to be excusable; these are seen as tampering with the creation of Allah for the sake of beauty. Examples include: breast enlargement or reduction, and procedures aimed at reversing the signs of ageing, such as face-lifts etc. The Islamic view is that these are not permitted, because there is no urgent need or necessity for them; rather, the aim is to change and tamper with the creation of Allah for reasons of human vanity. This is haram and the one who does it is cursed because it involves two things mentioned in the hadith: pursuit of beauty and changing what Allah has created. Added to this is the fact that these operations are aimed at deceit, and may involve the injection of materials extracted from aborted foetuses. These are very serious crimes. Moreover, many of these operations result in ongoing pain and other side effects, as the specialists themselves say. (See Ahkam al-Jirahah (Rulings on surgery) by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti). On the basis of the above, we say to you: if the disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce an accidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it, in sha Allah. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "we delve deeper into the background of Dr. Manasseh's work and his views on the practice of plastic surgery. He explains that it is a medical procedure that involves improving the appearance of parts of the body but does not involve changing what Allah created.

In explanation of Verse 3 of Surat al-Ma\u2019ida, or the table, Ibn Kathir said: \"The Verse: \"..., and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...\" means that eating of animal food on which, upon slaughtering a name other than Allah is invoked is forbidden because Allah, the Exalted, prescribed that His Great Name be invoked upon slaughtering any of His creatures. It is the unanimous opinion that one is forbidden to select to invoke a name of an idol of any creature upon slaughtering an animal.

Ibn Jurayj said: There were 360 stones (altars) at which pre-Islamic Arabs used to slaughter animal... They would grill meat and put it on these stones.. Allah forbade such act and disallowed eating of such meat even if the name of Allah is invoked on it. Slaughtering of animal at stones (altars) is part of polytheism, which is prohibited by Allah and His Messenger. Comparison should be made to the foregoing to decide the rule for slaughtering of animals on which is invoked other than the name of Allah.

O ye assembly of Jinns and men! if it be ye can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth pass ye! not without authority shall ye be able to pass!\" Jazakallahu Khair.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.; Verse 33 of Surat al-Rahman, interpretation of the meaning: \"O ye assembly of Jinns and men! If you can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, pass ye! Not without authority shall ye be able to pass!\" This challenge from Allaah to all will be on the day of resurrection when all creatures, Jinn and humans, will be assembled and the heavens split apart. Angels will descend from all of heavens and encircle the resurrected. Allah will challenge the people assembled to escape if they can. They will not be able to escape as they will not have the ability or the power to do so with the angels besieging and encircling them from all sides. In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"Meaning that you cannot escape Allaahs power and predestination, which are everywhere around you. You cannot escape Allahs power or break away from His authority or ruling on you. On the day of resurrection, wherever you go, you will be surrounded on all sides by seven rows of angels. No one can pass beyond the zones \"without authority\" i.e. an order from Allah. Verse 10 of Surat Al-Qiyamah, or the resurrection, says (interpretation of the meaning): \"(10.) That day will man say: Where is the escape? (11.) By no means! No place of safety! 12. Before thy Lord (alone), that day will be the dwelling.\"",

What are the limits within which women may uncover when Qur\u2019aan is read over them for this purpose?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is Sunnah to learn ruqyah as prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, seeking to benefit the Muslims and treat these chronic diseases, because the Book of Allaah is a beneficial healing. But it is not permissible for a non-mahram man to touch any part of a woman\u2019s body when doing ruqyah, and it is not permissible for her to uncover any part of her body such as her chest, neck, etc. He should recite over her even if she is covered, and this will be of benefit no matter where the pain is.

There is no need to examine the nature of their marriage contract or how it was done, and it is not essential that their contract should have fulfilled the conditions of the Muslim marriage contract, namely the wali (woman\u2019s guardian), witnesses and the format of the proposal and acceptance, and so on. There is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning that. Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if a couple become Muslim together at the same time, they remain together on the basis of their (original) marriage contract, so long as there are no ties of blood or via breastfeeding between them. Many people became Muslim at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and their wives also became Muslim, and their marriage contracts were accepted. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask them about the conditions of their marriage or how they had got married.

Her real father is muslim, but she calls him daddy, and for the sake of unity in the home, we want her to call her stepfather Abi like the others do.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Before answering this question, it will be useful to shed more light on the issue of adoption and giving a child a name or lineage that is not really his. In Islam, adoption (i.e., giving your name to a child who is not yours) is haraam, and is considered to be a major sin because of the wrongdoing and corruption that result from it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah\" [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever claims knowingly to belong to someone other than his father will be denied Paradise.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, Fath, no. 3982). He also said: \"Whoever claims to belong to someone other than his father, will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people, and Allaah will not accept any deeds or excuses from him on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 2433). In his commentary on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi said: \"This is clearly stating the emphatic prohibition of claiming to belong to anyone other than one's real father because this involves ingratitude and a denial of the rights of inheritance, as well as cutting family ties and undutifulness to parents.\" (al-Nawawi's statement ends). It also involves not carrying out the rules of inheritance, and ignoring the prohibited degrees of marriage to women [i.e. a man may unknowingly marry someone he is not permitted to, such as a sister, when true origins are concealed by not calling a child after his real father - translator's note], etc. If a man wants to sponsor an orphan, the child must still be named after his father, if his name is known; it is not permissible to attribute this child to himself by giving him his name. If the child's real origins are not known, then he should be given an appropriate name by which he may be known to others, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah. But if you know not their father's (names, call them) your brothers in faith \" [al-Ahzaab 33:5] In answer to your question, which has to do with a girl - for example - addressing the one who is sponsoring her and bringing her up as \"Father\" or \"Daddy,\" Shaykh 'Abd al-'Azeez ibn Baaz has issued a fatwa (ruling) stating that this is allowed, because he is acting in the position of a father to her, and we should not be so strict in this matter. Note: If a man is sponsoring a very young girl (less than two years old) he should try to establish the relationship of mahram by letting her breastfeed from his wife, mother or sister, so that she will become his mahram, otherwise he has to make sure that she does not uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of him when she grows up. The exception to this is a step-daughter (his wife's daughter from a previous marriage); she does not have to wear hijaab in front of her mother's husband even if no relationship is established through breastfeeding (al-radaa').",
        "summary": "Before answering the question of adoption, it's important to know that there is no way to give a child his or her father's name. In fact, adoption is considered a major sin in Islam because of the \"advocacy and denial of rights of inheritance\" as well as the \"decree cutting family ties\". Also, adoption occurs when you do not tell someone else that your real father is around. If you don't want to sponsor someone who has an orphan, then it's not okay to attribute the child to himself; it's even worse if the child doesn't have a real father. Adopted sons are not allowed to be named after their fathers until they are old enough to go to school. Adoptive sons will still be called adopted sons by their fathers, but they will not be allowed to call their brothers in faith.Adopted sons will be cursed according to the laws of inheritance, while those who claim to belong to one other will be denied paradise. All this is to say, however, that anyone who does not take action against his/her real father will be doomed to eternal damnation on Day of Resurrection.",

If she prays and any part of her \u2018awrah becomes uncovered, such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said: \"Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a khimaar (covering)\" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi, with a saheeh isnaad) Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a dir\u2019 (chemise or upper garment) and a khimaar (head cover), but no izaar (lower garment). He said: \"The woman is \u2018awrah.\" As for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer, so long as no non-mahram men are present. According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite. Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a khimaar and qamees (dress or gown). She said, \"There is nothing wrong with it if the dir\u2019 (chemise) covers her feet.\" In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side.

Hadith No. 6183 in Sahih al-Jami\u2019.) Anbasah ibn Abi Sufyan quoted Umm Habibah as saying \"Allah\u2019s Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"A house will be built in Heaven for one who prays 12 Rak'at in a day and evening as follows: 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib Prayer, 2 after the \u2018Isha Prayer and 2 before the Fajr Prayer.\" (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 380. He said: The Hadith narrated by Anbasah quoting Umm Habibah in this chapter is a hassan and sahih hadith. It is under No. 6362 in Sahih al-Jami\u2019.) The \u2018Asr (Late-Afternoon) Prayer has no routine Sunnah (basic recommended voluntary prayer). However, it is mustahab (preferable and recommended) that one prays 4 Rak'at before the \u2018Asr Prayer. The 4 Rak'ahs are of less reward and significance in importance of adhering to them compared to the \"sunan al-rawatib\" described above. The 4 Rak'ahs are the ones intended by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in saying: \"May Allah have mercy on one who prays 4 rak\u2019at before the \u2018Asr Prayer.\" (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi no. 395 and he declared it a hassan and gharib Hadith. Al-Albany rated the Hadith as hassan in Sahih al-Jami\u2019 No. 3493.) All the foregoing 4-Rak'ah voluntary prayers are to be prayed two at a time according to Imam ash-Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Everyone must fear Allaah and realize that He is watching them in private and in public. They should know that He can see them and that nothing at all is hidden from Him on the earth or in the heavens. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:197] \u2013 i.e., O you whose minds are aware and whose hearts are alive, strive to please Allaah by doing that which will bring you benefits in this world and in the Hereafter. Those who are not \u201cmen of understanding\u201d are those who waste their efforts and their minds in things that earn the wrath of Allaah. What the questioner has asked about, organizing singing parties and soirees to which singers and actors from all over are invited, to which entrance is free or there is a charge, and attending or watching these events, or taking part in them or supporting them \u2013 all of that is haraam and is not permitted, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur\u2019aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).\u201d [Luqmaan 31:6] Ibn Mas\u2019ood \u2013 may Allaah be pleased with him \u2013 used to swear that what this referred to was singing, because undoubtedly singing misleads people far away from the path of Allaah by wasting their time. It was reported from Abu \u2018Aamir and Ibn Maalik al-Ash\u2019ari (may Allaah be pleased with them) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThere will be among my ummah people who will permit illegal sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical instruments...\u201d (narrated by al-Bukhaari). The meaning of the phrase \u201c[they] will permit illegal sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical instruments...\u201d is that these things are basically haraam. The word translated as \u201cthere will be\u201d refers to something which will happen in the future. What this means is that there will be people who regard as halaal and allow themselves things that are haraam, such as zinaa, silk and musical instruments. It was reported from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) in a marfoo\u2019 report: \u201cIn this ummah there will be landslides, stones falling from heaven and transformation (of humans into monkeys, etc.). This will happen when alcohol is drunk, when people bring in female singers and play musical instruments.\u201d (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi). No doubt the things that bring about these punishments are haraam, and are in fact major sins \u2013 laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is no strength and no power except with Allaah). The earlier scholars, such as Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) stated that musical instruments \u2013 such as the \u2018ood (lute), tanboor (long-necked stringed instrument similar to a mandolin), shabbaab (reed flute) and rabaab (stringed instrument resembling a fiddle) \u2013 are haraam, so the instruments that are known nowadays, which cause far more fitnah (temptation) are even more haraam than those which were known to the earlier scholars. Therefore: it is haraam to organize singing parties such as these. Let those who organize them fear Allaah, and let those who are in positions of authority fear Allaah and not take their children and families to these places. Let them realize that they are sinning by doing so, and tomorrow they will be asked about what they have done. Let them know that they can find relaxation in obeying Allaah and adhering to His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by fasting, visiting the Haramayn (Makkah and Madeenah), and by striving in jihaad for the sake of Allaah, spreading the religion of Allaah and calling others to Islam, and other kinds of good and righteous deeds. They can also find relaxation in other permissible activities, such as learning to swim, shoot and ride horses, as well as sailing, going to gardens and parks, etc., so long as they observe Islamic etiquette and good manners.

In matters on which sharee\u2019ah is silent and did not give any specific ruling, we are permitted to act within the general guidelines of Islam, such as the principle of not causing or reciprocating harm, and so on. There is a big difference between this incident and its implications, and the reports in which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that things were halaal or haraam, or that something would lead to punishment or not, or that certain transactions are valid or not, and other worldly or religious matters, because these formed the main part of his mission, and Allaah has commanded us to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in everything that he has conveyed from his Lord. (al-Mawsoo\u2019ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 1/45). Those who try to confine Islam only to rituals of worship, such as prayer, fasting and Hajj, and want to separate religion from other aspects of life such as the social, economic and political spheres, and say that these are human affairs in which people can do whatever they want and can legislate and govern however they wish \u2013 these people are kaafirs and wrongdoers who do not want to make the sharee\u2019ah of Allaah prevail in people\u2019s lives or to allow Islam to guide the people\u2019s affairs, even though Allaah has revealed it to govern and control and regulate, and life cannot be properly run and people cannot be happy without it. Without Islamic rule, people are lost and confused in the darkness, as we see today in all those societies that are not ruled by the sharee\u2019ah of Allaah. We ask Allaah to guide us and to open our eyes and help us to accept and follow Islam. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

With regard to Hanbali or Shaafa\u2019i madhhabs, you do not have to restrict yourself to that. Those (four) scholars have a high status that is well known throughout this Ummah; their words were written down and followed by their companions and followers, and became madhhabs that were recognized and known, even though they were agreed on matters of belief and Tawheed. They were also close to one another on minor issues, but it so happened that one of them might be unaware of some evidence (daleel) or its correct interpretation, so he made ijtihaad and issued fatwaas based on his ijtihaad. They did not oblige others to adhere to what they said, but most of those followers adopted sectarian attitudes and restricted themselves to the views of those imaams even if they went against the daleel. They went to great length to interpret the texts in such a manner as to make them agree with what they thought.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This swearing by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is haraam, and is a kind of Shirk, because swearing by something implies veneration of it, and a created being cannot venerate another created being. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever swears by anything other than Allaah is guilty of kufr or shirk.\u201d (Saheeh, narrated by Ahmad, 2/125; Abu Dawood, 3251; al-Tirmidhi, 1535). This applies to swearing by the Prophets, angels, righteous people and all other created beings. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever swears an oath, let him swear by Allaah or else remain silent.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari,4860 \u2013 al-Fath 8/611 and 6107 \u2013 al-Fath 10/516; Muslim, 1647; Ahmad, 2/309; Abu Dawood, 3247; al-Nasaa\u2019i, 3775; al-Tirmidhi, 1545; Ibn Maajah, 2096). With regard to the verses in the Qur\u2019aan which contain oaths sworn by \u201cthose sent forth\u201d (al-mursalaat), the winds that scatter (al-dhaariyaat), those who pull out (al-naazi\u2019aat), the break of day (al-fajr), the Time (al-\u2018asr), the forenoon (al-duhaa) and the mansions of the stars (mawaaqi\u2019 al-nujoom \u2013 see al-Waaqi\u2019ah 56:75), etc., these are oaths sworn by Allaah, and Allaah has the right to swear oaths by whatever He wills, but the created being can swear only be his Lord, may he be exalted.",
        "summary": "The swearing of the Prophet is a haraam. This is a form of shirk. It is a sign that something is venerating it, or that another created being has an interest in it. In other words, anyone who swears by something other than the authority of Allaah will be judged for kufr and shirk because they are venerating one created being. The verse in the Qur'an contains an oath, sworn by those sent forth. The winds that scatter, the winds that move, those who pull away; al-naaziat. The break of dayAl-Fajr, the time (al-falada) and the forenoon are all signs of the dawn.

However, I am married to a devout Mormon (LDS) woman, and have... children, whom I have promised to raise in her religion. My question has two parts: First, what is the position of a man accepting Islam with a Christian wife, and practicing Islam independently of her, and Second, what of a promise to raise my children in a religion other than Islam. Obviously, I would seek to expose them to Islam, but I am wondering about things such as supporting her desire to have them attend her church, etc.Thanks very much, (name witheld).",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Dear (name witheld), As-salaamu 'ala man ittaba'a al-huda (peace be upon those who follow the true guidance). I was delighted to learn of your serious consideration and possible intention to accept the Islamic religion. No doubt that step would be the greatest thing in the entire NN years of your life. This step is the one that will protect you from the everlasting punishment of Hell and open to you the path to Heaven after death and will result in success and happiness in this life and the hereafter. I advise you to hasten with your decision and do not hesitate and postpone. You seem to me to be of sound wisdom that will lead you the path of truth by the will of God (Allaah). As for your first question, it is permissible in the Islamic religion for a Muslim to marry a woman from the People of the Book (Christain or Jew) if she is chaste (i.e. of high moral character) and virtuous, as Allaah has stated in the noble Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning of verse number 5 in the chapter entitled \"Al-Maa'ida,\" The Table): \"This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues (girlfriends or lovers)...\" Based on this verse, your marriage contract will remain valid if you accept Islaam and become a Muslim, and it will not require renewal. Your remaining with your current wife is permissible as long as she is virtuous and chaste in marriage. As for your second question, the child in Islamic law must follow the Muslim among his or her parents, and it is the Muslim parent's right and responsibility to ensure his or her proper upbringing, guidance, and supervision. Your statement that you would seek to expose your children to Islaam is a wise and judicious foresight. And we hope that with the passing of time that they will be convinced of this religion and implement it in their lives. No doubt that you will face some difficulty in convincing your wife to raise your children in the Islamic religion considering the promise you have made to her. However, the use of wisdom and gentle judgment will aid you, God willing, in overcoming this difficulty. This is important especially considering that it is expected that you will exert a concentrated effort in inviting your wife to Islam, since if she accepts it, the problem will be solved from its roots. In any case, and no matter what the results, the first step towards success will be your accepting the religion of Islaam yourself. We pray to God (Allaah) the Almighty and Magnificent that He eases your affairs and brings you success in finding the path of truth and that he guides your entire famliy to Islam. I would be more than happy to dicuss any other questions or concerns you may have. Salaam. Peace.",

You can still marry your current wife if you want, but that contract will not need to be renewed.

        "question": "Are a men and women allowed to have sex on their wedding night? If so, how often are the husband and the wife allowed to have intercourse; once a week and so on?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.How often husband and wife make love Yes, the couple can have intercourse on the first night of their marriage if they want to. There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate the number of times a couple may or should have intercourse, because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences. As long as people vary in their abilities, it is not possible for the Shari`ah to impose a specific number in such cases. But intercourse is the right of the wife and is a duty on the husband. Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cIntercourse is a duty on the man \u2013 i.e., the husband should have intercourse with his wife \u2013 so long as he has no excuse. This is also the opinion of Malik.\u201d (al-Mughni, 7/30) Imam al-Bukhari reported from \u2018Abd-Allah ibn \u2018Amr ibn al-\u2018As, who said: \u201cThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018O \u2018Abd-Allah, have I not heard that you fast all day and stand all night in prayer?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes, O Messenger of Allah.\u2019 He said: \u2018Do not do that. Fast and break your fast, stand in prayer and sleep. For your body has rights over you, your eyes have rights over you, and your wife has rights over you.\u2019\u201d In the commentary on this hadith, it says: \u201cThe husband should not exhaust himself in worship to the extent that he becomes too weak to fulfil her rights by having intercourse with her and by earning a living.\u201d (Fath al-Bari) It is also the wife\u2019s right that her husband should spend his nights with her. Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali said: \u201cIf he has a wife, he should spend one night in four with her, so long as he has no excuse.\u201d (Al-Mughni, 7/28; Kashf al-Qina\u2019, 3/144). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: \u201cIt is obligatory for the husband to have intercourse with his wife as much as is needed to satisfy her, so long as this does not exhaust him physically or keep him away from earning a living... If they dispute over this matter, the judge should prescribe more in the way of intercourse just as he may prescribe more in the way of spending.\u201d (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah min Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 246) The Shari`ah also requires that a wife be protected from immorality by means of her husband having intercourse with her, as much as is needed to satisfy her and to provide this protection. But there is no way that this can be stated in terms of a specific period of time, such as four months, or more, or less. It should be defined according to the wife\u2019s needs and her husband\u2019s ability to fulfil her rights... All of this applies in normal circumstances, when the husband is present and living with his wife. If the husband is absent from his wife because he is travelling for a legitimate purpose or other legitimate excuse, in this case the husband should try not to be absent from his wife for too long. If he is absent because he is doing something for the benefit of the Muslims as a whole, such as participating in jihad for the sake of Allah or patrolling the borders of Islam, he should be permitted to go back to his family once every four months or less, so that he can spend time with them before returning to his duties in jihad or border patrol. This was the policy of \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who stipulated that soldiers and members of the border patrol should be absent from their wives for only four months, after which time they should be brought back and others sent to take their place...\u201d (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah by Zaydan, 7/239) For more, please see these answers: 1202, 91968, 4807, and 6792.

May Allah guide, protect and bless you for all the help you have given to so many people across the world by answering our questions and ending our dilemmas.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. First of all, let me congratulate you for reaching a conviction that Islam is true and that it is the only religion which meets the needs of mans soul and fills it with tranquillity and joy. From the way in which you phrased your question, it is clear that what you have read about Islam has had an effect on you, so much so that if you had not stated that you are Hindu, we would have thought you were Muslim. The most important thing I want to say to you is to advise you to hasten to enter Islam, and do it sooner rather than later. Once a person is convinced of the truth, what reason is there to delay embracing Islam? There is another point which also needs to made clear. Some of those who want to enter Islam delay doing so until they have learnt some practical aspects of this faith, such as how to pray and so on, because they think that they are not fit to enter the religion until they have learnt some of its teachings. This is not correct; once the truth is clear to a person, it is his duty to follow it and enter Islam straight away. Then he can learn about the Quran and Sunnah and broaden his understanding of Islam. The Muslim is required to take learning and practice step by step, as much as he is able to, because no one knows when he or she will die. If a person meets Allaah (dies) with a religion other than Islaam, he will be one of the doomed. Furthermore, a person will not be rewarded and no hasanaat will be recorded for him until after he has entered Islaam, so he will lose a lot of benefits if he delays his Islaam; time wasted can never be recovered. Now let us go back to your question, which has to do with the thirty-ninth aayah of Soorah Yaa-Seen. In this aayah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse)\" [Yaa-Seen 36:39], i.e., We have made it progress through stages by which the passing of months can be measured, just as night and day are known from the sun. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): \"They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage...\" [al-Baqarah 2:189] \"It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light, and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of their years and the reckoning...\" [Yoonus 10:5] Allaah has given the sun its own light and has given the moon a (reflection) of light, and has made their courses different, so that the sun rises every day and sets at the end of of the day with one unchanging kind of light, but the positions of its rising and setting vary from summer to winter, because of which the days may be long and the nights short, then the days become short and the nights long. The sun is dominant in the day, so it is the heavenly body of the daytime. As for the moon, Allaah has measured for it mansions or stages, so that on the first night of the month it rises as a faint crescent, giving little light, then its light increases in stages and its position gets higher each night. Every time its position is higher, it has more light, even though it is a reflection of the suns light, until its light becomes complete, on the fourteenth of the month, when it is a full moon. Then it starts to decrease until, at the end of the month, it \"returns like the old dried curved date stalk\" Ibn Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: \"This is the stalk of a bunch of dates.\" Mujaahid said: \"It is a dried stalk.\" Ibn Abbaas meant: the stalk of a bunch of dates when it becomes old, dry and bent. (Reference: Tafsir Ibn Katheer). This likening of the moon at the end of the month to an old dried curved date stalk is a beautiful example of eloquence, by choosing a simile from the environment of the first listeners. And Allaah knows best.",

He then goes back to the 30 th aayah, in which the prophet declares that the sun, moon, and the moon are measuring the progress of mankind's mansions and their stages.

I believe that the Salafi da\u2019wah is correct and that those who follow it have the sound \u2018aqeedah (belief), but there are some matters I want to ask about. How correct is it from an Islamic point of view to use the word \u201cSalafi\u201d and to describe oneself in this way? If a person says that he is a Salafi, is he praising himself? Is this considered to be dividing the ummah? If we tell the Sufis that their madhhab is not correct, and that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions taught it, they will respond that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions did not use the word \u201cSalafi\u201d either, so how should we reply to them?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jama\u2019ah? We can answer this question with the following points: Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jama\u2019ah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): \u201cSay (O Muhammad): \u2018This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the mushrikeen (polytheists... those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah).\u201d [Yusuf 12:108] \u201cAnd whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers\u2019 way, We shall keep him in the oath he has chosen, and burn him in Hell \u2013 what an evil destination!\u201d [al-Nisa 4:115] Who are the Salaf? Whoever follows the way of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) belongs to the salaf al-salih, even if the people call him something else; by the same token, whoever goes against it and deviates from the Sunnah is an innovator, even if he claims to be a Salafi. Can you say \u2018I am a Salafi\u2019? If a person calls himself a Salafi to express his gratitude for having been guided to this way, or to clearly distinguish himself from innovation, then this is OK and is allowed in Islam. But if he says it only for the purpose of praising himself, then this is not allowed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... therefore justify not yourselves...\u201d [al-Najm 53:32]. Similarly, it is not allowed if it is said in a spirit of tribalism or sectarianism, because such attitudes are forbidden, as is clear from the following story: Jabir ibn \u2018Abd-Allah said: \u201cA man from the Muhajireen shoved a man from the Ansar from behind, so each man\u2019s people gathered around him, saying \u2018O Muhajireen (come and help)!\u2019 or \u2018O Ansar (come and help)!\u2019 News of this reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said, \u2018Stop this, for it is repulsive.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah? What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah?\u2019\u201d (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 14105; the hadeeth is also to be found in al-Sahihayn). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it the call of the people of jahiliyyah and described it as repulsive, even though the words \u201cAnsari\u201d and \u201cMuhajiri\u201d are Islamic words, the first referring to those who supported Allah and His Messenger, and the second referring to those who left the land of kufr and migrated to Allah and His Messenger. Why were they described in this manner? Because in this instance, the words were not used in a permissible fashion; the usage was a sectarian and political one that could have led to fighting between the two groups. The same applies to the word \u201cSalafi\u201d. If the Ahl al-Sunnah and the salaf draw a line between themselves and the innovators, this is not considered to be dividing the ummah, as those who criticize the use of this word think is the case, but this distancing of oneself has to be done in accordance with the degree of bid\u2019ah \u2013 whether it is major or minor \u2013 and should be regulated by the overall interests of the Islamic da\u2019wah. Response to the Sufi claims The Sufi claims mentioned in the question are not valid. The denunciation is not merely because of the word \u201cSufi\u201d, which is a general word that may be applied to things approved of in Islam, such as asceticism (zuhd) and fear of Allah, or it may be applied to innovations such as monasticism and extremism. Rather the denunciation is because of the various types of shirk, major and minor, that are connected with Sufism and its tariqahs. The word Tasawwuf (Sufism) now refers to the Sufi tariqahs and the kinds of innovations they have. Sufism \u2013 as is obvious from their books and how Sufis actually are \u2013 includes deviant ideas of kufr, such as hulool (incarnation or the belief that the Creator may be indwelling in His creation \u2013 exalted be Allah above what they say), ittihad (union) and wahdat al-wujood (pantheism or the unity of existence, which is the belief that the Creator and His creation are the same thing, and that everything in existence is Allah \u2013 exalted be Allah above what they say), and going to extremes in what they say about the awliya, in addition to their innovations in the matter of acts of worship and awrad (du\u2019as). Your way to salvation The one who is seeking salvation has to work hard to gain beneficial knowledge and do righteous deeds, and he should avoid vain arguments and futile discussions in which there is no benefit. We ask Allah to help us and you to follow the truth and act upon it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",

Why does it not state the fifth prayer? PS. I'am a practicig Muslim (Inshallah) and I'am in no way trying to prove the Qur'an wrong.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the Tafseer of this aayah, it is reported that Ibn \u2018Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \u201cThe five daily prayers are (mentioned) in the Qur\u2019aan.\u201d He was asked, \u201cWhere?\u201d He said, \u201cAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening\u2019 is maghrib and \u2018isha\u2019; \u2018and when you enter the morning\u2019 is fajr; \u2018in the afternoon\u2019 is \u2018asr; and \u2018the time when the day begins to decline\u2019 is zuhr.\u201d Other mufassireen, such as al-Dahhaak and Sa\u2019eed ibn Jubayr said the same thing. Some of the mufassireen said that these aayat mention only four of the prayers; \u2018isha\u2019 is not mentioned here, but it is mentioned in Soorat Hood, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... and in some hours of the night...\u201d [Hood 11:114] Most of the mufassireen are of the first opinion. Al-Nahhaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThe scholars of Tafseer say that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening and when you enter the morning...\u2019 [al-Room 30:17] refers to the prayers.\u201d Imaam al-Jassaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \u201cAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018... The prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times [mawqootan].\u2019 [al-Nisa\u2019 4:103]. It was reported that \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: \u2018[Mawqootan means that] Salaah has an appointed time just as Hajj does.\u2019 It was reported that Ibn \u2018Abbaas, Mujaahid and \u2018Atiyyah said [that mawqootan means] \u2018It is obligatory\u2019... The word \u2018mawqootan\u2019 means that it is obligatory at certain times. The times are referred to in general terms in this aayah and are explained elsewhere in the Book, without defining precisely when those times start and end \u2013 that was explained in detail by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What Allaah mentioned about the times of the prayers in His Book is (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cPerform al-Salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night and recite the Qur\u2019aan in the early dawn...\u201d [al-Isra\u2019 17:78]. Mujaahid reported from Ibn \u2018Abbaas: \u201c\u2019Mid-day\u2019 means when the sun has passed its zenith for salaat al-zuhr, and \u2018the darkness of the night\u2019 means the beginning of the night, for salaat al-maghrib.\u201d It was also reported from Ibn \u2018Umar that mid-day meant the zenith... Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night\u201d [Hood 11:114]. \u2018Amr reported from al-Hasan that \u2018the two ends of the day\u2019 means fajr at the first end and zuhr and \u2018asr at the other; \u2018some parts of the night\u2019 means maghrib and \u2018isha\u2019. So according to this opinion the aayah refers to all five prayers.... Layth reported from al-Hakam from Abu \u2018Ayyaad that Ibn \u2018Abbaas said: \u201cThis aayah mentions all five prayers together. \u2018So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening\u2019 refers to maghrib and \u2018isha\u2019, \u2018and when you enter the morning\u2019 refers to fajr, \u2018in the afternoon\u2019 is \u2018asr; and \u2018the time when the day begins to decline\u2019 is zuhr.\u201d Something similar was also reported from al-Hasan. Abu Razeen reported from Ibn \u2018Abbaas: \u201c \u2018...and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting\u2019 [Qaaf 50:39 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning] refers to the prescribed prayers. \u2018... and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and during some of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day, that you may become pleased with the reward which Allaah shall give you.\u2019 [Ta-Ha 20:130 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning] This aayah also includes the times of the prayers. All of these aayaat mention the times of the prayers.\u201d Ahkaam al-Qur\u2019aan by al-Jassaas, Baab Mawaaqeet al-Salaah. What you should also know is that the Qur\u2019aan does not contain details of all the rules. The Qur\u2019aan mentions many rules, but it also tells us that the Sunnah is a source of evidence in which many rules are mentioned in detail that are not mentioned in the Qur\u2019aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): \u201c... and We have also sent down to you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Qur\u2019aan), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them and that they may give thought.\u201d [al-Nahl 16:44] \u201c... and whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it...\u201d [al-Hashr 59:7] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cI have been given the Qur\u2019aan and something like it with it...\u201d (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16546; this is a saheeh hadeeth). Whether the rules were narrated in the Qur\u2019aan or in the Sunnah, all of it is true and right, and all of it has one source, which is the wahy or revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.",

        "question": "I am speaking under correction. Please do correct me if I don't have my facts right: According to The Bible there is no country such as Israel, only Palestine. The Jew and the Arab, both stemming from Abraham is in fact half brothers. So why can they not live in harmony in a new country called Palestine?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Your question may be answered by the following points: There is no doubt that the Prophet of Allaah Ibraaheem (Abraham) was a pure monotheist, and he was not among the polytheists and disbelievers. Although the Jews are among the offspring of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), they went against his way by associating partners in worship with Allaah and claiming that Uzayr (Ezra) was a son of God. They said that God is miserly and that His hand is tied up, and they said, He is poor and we are rich. They also said that when God created the heavens and the earth in six days, He got tired, so He rested on the Sabbath day exalted be Allaah far above all that they say about Him. They also likened the attributes of God to human attributes (anthropomorphism) and killed the Prophets, etc., etc. Once this distinction and contrast is made clear, there can be no brotherhood between a monotheistic believer and a polytheistic disbeliever, as Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever, - until you believe in Allaah Alone, except the saying of Ibraaheem to his father: Verily, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allaah) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allaah. Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return, - Certainly, there has been in them an excellent example for you to follow, - for those who look forward to (the Meeting with) Allaah (for the reward from Him) and the Last Day. And whosoever turn away, then verily, Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all Praise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:4,6] Once this separation and enmity is clear, it is unavoidable that there will be hostility and disavowal and the resulting struggle against the enemies of Allaah. So long as the laws and wisdom of Allaah dictate that there should the distinction between believers and disbelievers, there has to be this clearly-stated enmity. There can be no change to the laws of Allaah. There cannot be harmony between Jews who are usurpers and aggressors, who have oppressed and persecuted others, and who are known for their treachery and corruption throughout the world, historically and in the present age and the purely monotheistic Muslim owners of the land, whose menfolk the Jews have killed, and imprisoned their sons, and destroyed their homes, and taken possession of their lands by force, and prevented them from earning a proper living, and carried out chemical and radiational experiments on their prisoners, and taken organs from them for transplant into Jewish patients and all other kinds of persecutions and atrocities. In addition to this, the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal; it is not possible to trust them at all. Their current conduct bears this out: is there any treaty or agreement signed by them that they have actually fulfilled? This is no big surprise for the Muslims, who know what Allaah has said in His Book about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside? Nay! The truth is most of them believe not. [al-Baqarah 2:100]. Moreover, if the Muslims agreed to live in peace with the Jews, who would be in charge? One of the basic principles of Islam is that Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. One of the conditions for People of the Book (Jews and Christians) living with Muslims in a Muslim country is that they should live under certain conditions (shuroot ahl al-dhimmah) in return for the security and protection afforded them by the Muslims. One of the most important of these conditions is that they should not openly display their shirk and kufr (polytheistic disbelief) in the Muslim lands, whether by word or deed. As the Muslims and Jews are enemies residing in opposing religious and doctrinal camps, it is not possible for them to be brought together unless one is made to submit to the other by force. Indeed, the Jews now are not allowing the Muslims to remain in their homes, even if there was no provocative action on the part of the Muslims; they are seizing the Muslims property by force, building their settlements on the Muslims lands and expelling the Muslims by any means. They have expelled millions to the neighbouring countries, which have accommodated them in the so-called Palestinian refugee camps. Finally, although the Muslims nowadays are in a position of weakness and humiliation because they have turned away from their religion and are unable to fight the Jews, take back their stolen lands and impose the rule of Islamic shareeah in Palestine, this does not mean that this will always be the case until the end of the world. Things have to change, and one of the indications of this is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who informed us of some things that are to happen in the future. He was supported by Revelation from his Lord; he did not speak of his own whims and desires, but of that which was revealed to him. He said: You will fight the Jews and will prevail over them, so that a rock will say, O Muslim! There is Jew behind me, kill him! (Reported by Muslim, 2921; al-Bukhaari, 2926). According to a report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Hour [the Day of Judgement] will not begin until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. A Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him! except for the gharqad (box thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews. (Reported by Muslim, 2922).

I have been advised by a friend that there is a \"qawl\" (opinion) among some ulamaa' (scholars) that it is permissible to conduct anal sex (anal penetration) (between man and wife only) during the time of the wife's haydh (menstruation). Is this correct? Please also advise the laws and penalties relevant to it.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Your apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary. As regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: \"Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865). The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: \"The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918). In spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born. Another reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah. It is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal. I ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers.",

In fact, anal intercourse occurs a major sin whether it occurs during or after a woman's period or when she is pre- menstruation.

The narrator acknowledges that there are some men who threaten divorce if they don't obey the Prophet's wishes and deceive their wives into thinking that they are obeying him.

        "question": "Is there any prove from the Sunnah or ijtihad of the Sahaba that the praying (salat) of a woman is on some points different from the man, like it is in the Hanafi madhhab?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. The general principle is that women are equal to men in all religious rulings, because of the hadeeth \"Women are the twin halves of men\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and classified as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019 1983), except when there is evidence (daleel) of a specific ruling which applies only to women. One of the cases in which the scholars mention specific rules for women is prayer, where there are differences as follows: Women do not have to give adhaan or iqaamah, because adhaan requires raising the voice, which women are not permitted to do. Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"We know of no difference between the scholars (on this point).\" (Al-Mughni ma\u2019a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/438). All of the woman\u2019s body is \u2018awrah and must be covered during prayer, except for her face, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"No prayer will be accepted from an adult woman unless she wears a khimaar (head-cover). (Reported by the five Muhadditheen) There is some dispute as to whether her heels and feet should be covered. The author of al-Mughni (2/328) said: \"As for the rest of the free woman\u2019s body, it must be covered during prayer. If any part becomes uncovered, it renders her prayer invalid, except if only a little bit is uncovered. Maalik, al-Oozaa\u2019i and al-Shaafi\u2019i said the same. The woman should keep her limbs close to her body during rukoo\u2019 and sujood, and not spread them out, because this is more modest and covering. (Al-Mughni 2/258). Al-Nawawi said: \"Al-Shaafi\u2019i said, in al-Mukhtasar: there is no difference between men and women in prayer, except that women should keep the parts of their bodies close to one another, and they should make their stomachs touch their thighs during sujood. This is more covering and preferable, in rukoo\u2019 and the rest of the prayer too.\" (See al-Majmoo\u2019 3/429). It is preferable for women to pray in congregation, led by one of their number, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Umm Waraqah to lead the women of her household in prayer. There is some difference among scholars on this matter. (See al-Mughni, 2/202 and al-Majmoo\u2019 al-Nawawi, 4/84-85). The woman leading the prayer should read aloud as long as no non-mahram man can hear her. It is permissible for women to go out and pray in the mosque with men, although their prayer at home is better for them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Do not prevent the women from going out to the mosques, even though their homes are better for them.\" (For more details on this matter, see Question#973). Imaam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said (al-Majmoo\u2019 3/455): \"Women differ from men in congregational prayer in a number of ways: (1) Congregational prayer is not required of them in the same way as it is of men. (2) The imam of a group of women stands in the middle of the (first) row. (3) (If one woman and one man are praying), she should stand behind him, not next to him. (4) If women are praying in rows behind men, the back rows are better for them than the front rows. What we can learn from the above is that women and men are forbidden to mix. Allaah is our Helper and Support.",
        "summary": "The general principle of all religious rulings rests on the belief that women equal to men. It is important to note that this statement does not rest on the shoulders of one or the other, as it does not mention any specific ruling for women. All of the body is \"awrah,\" except for the free woman's body, which is covered during prayer; the Prophet said that no part of her body should be uncovered during prayer. However, some scholars have different opinions about whether or not a person should be allowed to wear a headcover in order to cover his or her face. Some scholars do not agree with each other on this point, but others do agree that it is preferable for an adult woman if she wears a head-cover. The five scholars disagree as to whether a person can pray without being able to see him or her. There is also some dispute over whether and how a person may pray without wearing a head cover. Finally, there is some debate as to what part of the free lady's body must be covered at prayer. For example, if anyone wants to pray without covering their entire bodies, it renders them invalid.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to watch these kinds of movies which tell stories of shirk. Seeing and hearing them can cause serious damage to the heart of the Muslim. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got angry with Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he saw him with a piece of the Tawraat (Torah) in his hand, and told him to destroy it. Many of the Muslims do not have sufficient protection or the level of knowledge required to recognize the corrupt ideas in these movies, so some viewers may develop doubts that damage their eemaan and shake their belief; they may start to believe some of the false ideas and their hearts may be filled with evil poisons as a result of watching these movies. This is in addition to the haraam content in many of these movies, such as pictures of women, music and so on. We may also note the recent appearance of movies based on distorted Biblical beliefs or the false prophecies of liars and charlatans. These movies have become very popular in the West because of the spiritual vacuum resulting from the lack of true religion. Due to the environment surrounding the Muslims in western countries, some of them have started to follow these movies. Muslims should fear their Lord and avoid watching these films of kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily! The hearing, and the sight, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah. [al-Isra 17:36] If Muslims want to entertain themselves, let them do so in permissible ways. And Allaah is the guide to the Straight Path.",
        "summary": "This section warns readers that it is not permissible for them to watch \"films\" which tell tales of shirk, deception, or false prophecies. These movies can cause damage to the eemaan; they may even lead to the loss of some of the essential beliefs and practices of the Muslim community.",

        "question": "Is there any evidence that the Prophet Muhammad was unable to read or write?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma\u2019roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful al-Tayyibaat (i.e., all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful al-khabaa\u2019ith (i.e., all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah\u2019s Covenant) and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honor him, help him and follow the light (the Qur\u2019aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.\" [al-A\u2019raaf 7:157] Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: \"Allaah says \u2018al-ummi.\u2019 Ibn \u2018Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: \u2018Your Prophet was unlettered, unable to read or write or calculate.\u2019 Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur\u2019an), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand...\u2019 [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:48].\" Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the second aayah quoted [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:48]: \"Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur\u2019aan), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand...\u2019 i.e., \u2018you (O Muhammad) lived among your people for a while before you brought this Qur\u2019aan to them, and you never read any book or were able to write anything. Everyone among your people and others knows that you are an unlettered man, who does not read or write.\u2019 This is how he was described in the previous Books as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma\u2019roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden)...\u2019 [al-A\u2019raaf 7:157]. Hence the Prophet will remain unable to write even one line or one letter, until the Day of Resurrection. He had scribes who would write down in front of him the Revelation and letters to different regions.... Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018... In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted.\u2019 [al-\u2018Ankaboot 29:48], i.e., if you had been good at it (reading and writing), some of the ignorant people would have doubted you and said that you had learnt this from the previous Books left by the Prophets. Indeed, they say this despite the fact that they know he was unlettered and unable to write, as it says in the Qur\u2019aan (interpretation of the meaning): \u2018And they say: \"Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\"\u2019 [al-Furqaan 25:5]\" Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book and al-Hikmah (al-Sunnah). And verily, they had been before in manifest error.\" [al-Jumu\u2019ah 62:2] Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: \"It was said: \u2018the unlettered ones\u2019 means those who do not write. Such were the Quraysh. Mansoor reported from Ibraaheem, who said: \u2018Al-ummi (the unlettered one) is the one who neither reads nor writes. \"A Messenger from among themselves\" means Muhammad, who was unlettered and never read a book nor learned how.\u2019 Al-Mawardi said: \u2018What is good about the fact that Allaah sent an unlettered Prophet? There are three things: (i) his message fulfilled the foretelling of the previous Prophets; (ii) this made him similar to and closer to other Prophets (illiterates); (iii) this would eliminate all suspicion that he had learned the message he preached from books and writings that he had read.\" I say: all of this is evidence of the miraculous nature and truth of his Prophethood. (The above has been summarized from the Tafseer of al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him).",
        "summary": "Praise for Allah. The ad-hoc statement says that those who follow the Prophet, who can read or write, will be successful because they will no longer have to deal with the heavy burdens of Covenant and from all the fetters that bind them. It also points out that there are three things that make him different from other Prophets: 1) His message fulfilled the prophecies; 2) his message was faithful; 3) he did not invent falsehood; and 4) he does not believe in polytheism, which is a heresy of all kinds. All of these are good qualities, according to Allaah.",

        "question": "I am deeply in love with a Muslim man and want to marry him. I know that Allah forbids girlfriend-boyfriend relationships, and feel very sorry in my heart for our relationship. I feel that because we have been in this relationship which is abhorred by Allah, he will never marry me because he has lost respect for me. What does the Quran say about having a girlfriend or a boyfriend?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends...\u201d [al-Nisa 4:25] In his commentary on this ayah, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cMuhsanat [translated as \u201cchaste\u201d] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zina (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musafihat, which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them. Regarding the phrase wa la muttakhidhati akhdan (\u2018nor taking boyfriends\u2019), Ibn 'Abbas said: \u2018al-musafihat means those who are known to commit zina, meaning those who will not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them.\u2019 Ibn 'Abbas also said: \u2018muttakhidhati akhdan means lovers.\u2019 A similar interpretation was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, al-Sha\u2019bi, al-Dahhak, \u2018Ata al-Khurasani, Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, Muqatil ibn Hayyan and al-Saddi. They said: (it means) lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: \u2018It means a (male) friend.\u2019 Al-Dahhak also said: \u2018wa la muttakhidhati akhdan also means a woman who has just one boyfriend or lover with whom she is happy. Allah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation...\u2019\u201d Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cMade lawful to you this day are al-tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) foods...]. The food of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other articles of Faith, then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.\u201d [al-Maidah 5:5] Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cMuhsineen ghayr musafiheen wa la muttakhidhi akhdan (\u2018desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends\u2019 ). Just as Allah imposed the condition of chastity on women, meaning that they refrain from zina, so it is also imposed on men. The man must also be pure and chaste. So they should be ghayr musafiheen, meaning they should not be adulterers who do not refrain from sin and do not refuse any who come to them (for immoral purposes). Nor should they be muttakhidhi akhdan, meaning those who have girlfriends or female lovers with whom they have an exclusive relationship, as quoted above from Surat al-Nisa. (The one with many lovers or the one with just one lover) are both the same. For this reason Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is not right to marry a promiscuous woman unless she has repented, or to arrange a marriage of such a woman to a chaste man, so long as she is still conducting herself in this manner. Similarly, he (Ahmad) says that it is not right for a promiscuous man to marry a chaste woman unless he repents and gives up his immoral conduct, because of this ayah... We will discuss this matter in further detail after quoting the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cLet no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden.\u201d [al-Nur 24:3] The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends Among the stories that show that it is forbidden to have girlfriends or to marry them is the story of Marthad ibn Abi Marthad, who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah to Madinah. There was a prostitute in Makkah, called \u2018Anaq, who had been a friend of Marthad\u2019s. Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madinah. He said: \u201cI came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then \u2018Anaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: \u2018Marthad?\u2019 I said, \u2018Marthad.\u2019 She said: \u2018Welcome! Stay with us tonight.\u2019 I said, \u2018O \u2018Anaq, Allah has forbidden zina (unlawful sexual relations)\u2019... I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, \u2018O Messenger of Allah, should I marry \u2018Anaq?\u2019 The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent and did not answer me at all, until the ayah \u2018Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman; to the believers such a thing is forbidden\u2019 [al-Nur 24:3 \u2013 Yusuf \u2018Ali\u2019s translation] was revealed. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u2018O Marthad, Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman, so do not marry her.\u2019\u201d (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3101; he said: it is a hasan gharib hadith). \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mughaffal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: \u201cStop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam.\u201d So he left her alone and went away, still looking at her, until he walked into a wall, hitting his face. He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cYou are a man for whom Allah wishes good. When Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, wishes good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for his sin, so that it is dealt with before the Day of Resurrection.\u201d (Reported by al-Hakim, 1/349, who said this hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. See Sahih al-Jami\u2019, 308). The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam These ayat and ahadith clearly indicate that it is haram (forbidden) for men to have any kind of friendship or relationship with non-mahram women (women to whom they are not closely-related and to whom they could get married). The evil consequences and misery caused by such relationships are obvious to anyone who observes real life. A similar question has been asked under #2085. We ask Allah to keep us far away from that which is forbidden, to protect us from all that may earn His wrath and to keep us safe from a painful punishment. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

Seeing that the money you have is in the form of paper currency paid to you as a grant from the Japanese government, the easiest way for you with regard to paying zakaah in this case is: wait until after one hijri year has passed, then check your bank and pay 2.5% (twenty-five out of every thousand) from whatever you have. But if you are living hand to mouth, as it were (i.e., spending it all straightaway), and you do not have enough left to reach the level of the nisaab, and a year has passed, then you are not obliged to pay zakaah in this case.

This method of payment is not mandatory on agricultural produce, fruits, vegetables, or even trade goods. If you're saving hand-to-ceiling as it were, and you don't have enough money to reach the Nisaab, then you aren't obliged to pay Zakaah in these circumstances.",

This is a serious warning. \u2018Abd-Allaah ibn al-\u2018Aas said: Whoever lives in the land of the mushrikeen and celebrates their Nawrooz (New Year) and their Mahrajaan (festivals), and imitates them until he dies, he will be a loser on the Day of Resurrection. Secondly: taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa\u2019 (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa\u2019 of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa\u2019), then surely, he is one of them... \u201c[al-Maa\u2019idah 5:51] \u201cO you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them\u201d [al-Mumtahanah 60:1] Thirdly: festivals are the matter of religion and beliefs, not the matter of worldly customs, as is indicated by the hadeeth: \u201cEvery nation has its Eid, and this is our Eid.\u201d Their Eid or festival reflects their corrupt beliefs of Kufr and Shirk. Fourthly: \u201cAnd those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass it by with dignity\u201d [al-Furqaan 25:72 \u2013 interpretation of the meaning].

        "question": "In Paradise will the servants of Allah remember the Previous world, and therefore, be able to desire Things that they desired on earth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. There is evidence in the Qur\u2019aan that the people of Paradise will remember the life of this world. For example, in Soorat al-Toor, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): \"And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: \u2018Aforetime, we were afraid with our families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.\" [al-Toor 52:25-28] They will also remember the evil people who tried to make the people of faith have doubts and called them to kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. A speaker of them will say, \u2018Verily, I had a companion (in the world), who used to say, \"Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death), (that) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?\" [al-Saffaat 37:50-53] They will remember the trials and tribulations they went though in this world, with regard to themselves, their children, their families and their wealth, and they will say joyfully: \"... \u2018All praise and thanks be to Allaah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).\u2019\" [Faatir 35:34] They will also be reminded of this life when they see the fruits which will resemble those which they used to eat in this world, but whose size and taste are different. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \u2018This is what we were provided with before,\u2019 and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e., in the same form but different in taste)...\" [al-Baqarah 2:25] They will also recall their du\u2019aa\u2019s in times of hardship, when they raised their hands to heaven asking for their deeds to be accepted and for help to do righteous deeds and to be included among those who would inherit blessings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: \u2018Aforetime, we were afraid with out families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.\" [al-Toor 52:25-28] As regards the matter of them desiring something like the blessings of this world, they will in fact desire something better than that, because even the person who is the lowest in status in Paradise will enjoy something like ten times the joys of this world. \u2018Abdullaah ibn Mas\u2019ood said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \u2018I know who will be the last person to be brought out of Hell and the last person to enter Paradise. It will be a man who will come out of Hell crawling. Allaah will say to him, \"Go and enter Paradise.\" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, \"O Lord, I found it full.\" Allaah will say to him a second time, \"Go and enter Paradise.\" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, \"O Lord, I found it full.\" Allaah will say to him, \"Go and enter Paradise, for there you will have something like the world and ten times more.\" The man will say, \"Are You making fun of me (or are You laughing at me), and You are the King of all?\"\u2019 - and I saw the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiling so broadly that his back teeth could be seen. He used to say, \u2018That is the person who is lowest in status in Paradise.\u2019\" [Agreed upon; this version is reported by Muslim, no. 272] Everything that the people of Paradise desire will be theirs, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... (there will be) therein all that one\u2019s inner-self could desire, all that the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever.\" [al-Zukhruf 43:71] A number of ahaadeeth state that the people of Paradise will have their desires for children or to grow things fulfilled, without having to wait for them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was speaking about the people of Paradise one day when a Bedouin was present. He described how a man of the people of Paradise will ask his Lord\u2019s permission to grow some plants. (In Arabic, the past tense is used here to show that this will undoubtedly happen). Allaah will ask him, \"Do you not already have all that you want?\" He will say, \"Yes, but I like to grow things.\" So he will go and plant his seeds, and within the blinking of an eye they will grow, ripen, be harvested and piled up like mountains. Allaah will say, \"Here you are, O son of Adam, nothing makes you satisfied!\" The Bedouin said, \"O Messenger of Allaah, you will find that he is either from Quraysh or the Ansaar, for they are the ones who like to grow things; we don\u2019t like to grow anything!\" The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiled broadly. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6965). Ibn Hijr reported the following hadeeth in Fath al-Baari; from it we learn that whatever worldly desires one wishes for in Paradise can be fulfilled. Abu Sa\u2019eed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2487. Abu \u2018Eesaa said: This is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth; see also Saheeh al-Jaami\u2019, 6649) We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy. And Allaah knows best.",

        "question": "What is the ruling on giving the zakaah of the Sunnis to the Raafidi (Shi\u2019ah) poor? If a Muslim who is obliged to pay zakaah gives it to a poor Raafidi, has he discharged his responsibility or not?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.In the chapters of their books which discuss who is entitled to receive zakaah funds, the scholars have stated that these funds are not to be given to a kaafir or an innovator (follower of bid\u2019ah). The Raafidis are undoubtedly kuffaar for four reasons: They cast aspersions on the Qur\u2019aan, claiming that two-thirds of it has been omitted, as is stated in their book by al-Noori which is called Fasl al-Khitaab fi Ithbaat Tahreef Kitaab Rabb al-Arbaab, and in Al-Kaafi, and other books. Whoever casts aspersions on the Qur\u2019aan is a kaafir who disbelieves in the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand surely, We will guard it (from corruption)\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9] They cast aspersions upon the Sunnah and the saheeh ahaadeeth. They do not follow them, because they were narrated from the Sahaabah who, according to them, are kuffaar. They believe that the Sahaabah became kaafirs after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, apart from \u2018Ali and his descendents, Salmaan, \u2018Ammaar and a few others. But with regard to the first three khaleefahs and the majority of the Sahaabah who gave their bay\u2019ah (oath of allegiance) to them, they think that they all apostatized and became kaafirs, so their ahaadeeth cannot be accepted. This is stated in al-Kaafi and other books of theirs. They regard the Sunnis (Ahl al-Sunnah) as kaafirs, so they do not pray with you. Whoever prays behind a Sunni will repeat his prayer. Indeed, they think that we are naajis (impure), and when they shake hands with us they go and wash their hands. Whoever regards the Muslims as kaafirs is himself a kaafir, so we regard them as kaafirs just as they regard us as kaafirs, and more so. They commit clear shirk in their exaggerations about \u2018Ali and his descendents and in their calling upon them alongside Allaah. This is stated clearly in their books, where they exaggerate about them and describe them in terms that are befitting only for the Lord of the Worlds. We have heard this in their tapes. They do not participate in the charity work of the Ahl al-Sunnah, or give charity to the Sunni poor; if they do these things, it is with deeply rooted and hidden hatred, and they do that as a form of taqiyyah (dissimulation, calculated deception). On these grounds, anyone who has given zakaah to them must pay his zakaah again, because he has given it to someone who will be helped in his kufr and to wage war against the Sunnah thereby. Whoever is obliged to pay zakaah is forbidden to give it to a Raafidi; if he does this, he has not discharged his obligation and he has to pay it again because he did not give the money with which he had been entrusted to the people who were entitled to receive it. Whoever doubts this, let him read the books that have been written in refutation of them, such as the book by al-Qifaari which refutes their way, and al-Khutoot al-\u2018Areedah by al-Khateeb, and the books of Ehsan Ilahi Zaheer, and others. And Allaah is the Source of Strength. [Note: al-Khutoot al\u2019Areedah and the books of Ehsan Ilahi Zaheer are availabe in English Translation. \u2013 Translator]",
        "summary": "The Raafid scholars do not agree with the interpretation of the Qur'aan, which states that only two-thirds has been included in the original text. The scholars also state that they will not give money to an innovator or a kuffar because they believe that there is no need for such funds. If anyone is entitled to Zakaah funds but does not follow it, it is not given to him or to an innovation. Whoever casts doubt on the veracity of the verifiable and the fact that two thirds of the text has been omitted completely is a naiadis. Those who cast aspersion on the sahaabah, Sunnis, and the sahadeeth are kaafirs. They repeat falsehoods about Ali and Salmaan and al-Ammaar. Anyone who exaggerates about them or exaggerates their prophecies should pay heed to the terms that are fitting only for the lord of the worlds. If someone gives zakaah away, he or she will have to pay it back.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-\u2018Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him: If a woman whose pregnancy has reached full term passes blood and has pains, but she does not know whether these are the contractions that will lead to childbirth or contractions that will later ease off [\u201cpractice\u201d contractions, also known as Braxton-Hicks contractions], should she pray or not? He answered, may Allaah preserve him: Of course, there are two things we may assume here: The first is that the pregnancy will continue without contractions. The second is that the apparent case is that these are contractions, so she should stop praying. If this is what usually happens to her, and she may carry on having contractions for four or five days without giving birth, then in this case she should still pray. Question: If she acts upon the second assumption, then the contractions ease off, should we tell her to make up the prayers she has missed? Answer: It is preferable to make them up, because she took her decision on the basis of an assumption. In summary, then: If this woman usually has contractions for a number of days \u2013 more than two or three \u2013 then this is not nifaas and she should pray. If that is not what usually happens, then we assume that it is nifaas in the sense that she should stop praying. If she stops praying, then it turns out that it was not nifaas, then in this case we say that if she makes up the prayers she has missed, this is good, and if she does not make them up, there is nothing wrong with that because she acted on an assumption.

(Some Muslim scholars that he should be physically reprimanded if he does not fast by the age of 10, which is the same rule that is applied to prayer; refer to Al Mughni 3/90). The boy will get a reward for fasting and his parents will get a reward for teaching him well and guiding him to that which is good. Al Rubayyi\u2019 bint Mu\u2019awwadh (may Allaah be pleased with her) said about fasting \u2018Aashouraa\u2019 at the time when it was mandatory to fast it and not voluntary: we used to make our young boys fast, and we made them a toy made out of wool. If one of the boys cried [wanting] food, we would give him [the toy to distract him] until it was time to break the fast.\" (Al Bukhari Fath # 1960). (Ashouraa is the tenth day of the month of Muharram. Although fasting this day is now voluntary the majority of Muslims usually fast.) Some people are quite lenient and lax when it comes to making their children fast. A situation may even arise where the young child feels enthusiastic and chooses to fast and is physically capable of doing so, then his father or mother order him to break his fast claiming that it is out of sympathy. Little do they know that real sympathy is in stressing the importance of fasting and teaching the child about it. Allaah said in Surat ul-Tahreem (interpretation of the meaning): \"O you who believe! Ward yourselves and your families off from a fire (Hell) whose fuel is of men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who do not disobey the commands they receive from Allaah, and execute that which they are commanded.\" We must pay extra attention to the young girl when she first starts fasting after she reaches puberty. There is a possibility that she will fast while she has her period (the first time) out of shame or shyness, and end up not making up the days later on. Also see the Book \"70 Matters Related to Fasting\".",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is rather unusual [in my opinion] to raise this kind of question. We ought to ask ourselves; is it really beyond our reach to have a large enough place, even if it were to be in a park, a stadium, etc., which would be sufficient to cater for the large number of praying people?

However, let us assume that the matter is neither due to laziness nor disorganisation, nor due to the fact that they are accustomed to performing Salaat in enclosed places and are not acclimated to performing it in open places. If all the aforementioned is true and the excuse is a valid one, the solution, as Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Ibn Baaz states, is to have numerous places where the Salaat can be performed, not through holding many congregations [at the same place]. This is because if they were to hold a second [or more] Salaat-ul \u2018Eed then it would count as if one is performing a missed Salaat, not as performing a Salaat at its due time, even though the Imaam would be changed and the congregation is a different one.

What it refers to is those who add hair extensions taken from the hair of other people, and the women who ask to have this done. The reason why this is forbidden is that it is false adornment which could be used to deceive or cheat others in matters of marriage and so on. As al-Bukhaari narrates from Mu\u2019aawiyah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called this falsehood. If we understand the hadeeth and the wisdom behind this prohibition, we will see that it does not include the wearing of ribbons and flower-shaped decorations by young girls. As long as wearing ribbons on the braids or necklaces made of white ribbon are not customs that belong exclusively to the kuffaar, there is nothing wrong with doing these things, because the principle is that everything is allowed unless it is expressly forbidden. But the girls who do these things should cover these decorations in front of people who are not their mahrams (blood relatives whom they are permanently forbidden to marry), if they are at the age where covering themselves is obligatory. But everything that is done exclusively by the kuffaar is haraam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to imitate or resemble them.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is waajib (obligatory) to let the beard grow, and shaving it is haraam (forbidden). Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others narrated from Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cBe different from the mushrikeen: let your beards grow and trim your moutsaches.\u201d Ahmad and Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cCut your moustaches and let your beards grow: be different from the Magians.\u201d Persisting in shaving one\u2019s beard is a major sin (kabeerah); the one who does this should be advised against it, and his action should be denounced, especially if he is in a position of religious leadership. The idea of being different from the Magians and other mushrikeen does not mean being different from them in every single thing, particularly if they happen to be doing something righteous or good in accordance with the fitrah (natural inclinations of man). What is meant is that we should be different from them in matters where they have gone astray and deviated from the truth and the dictates of the fitrah, and gone against the way of the Prophets and Messengers by shaving their beards. We should differ from them in this case by letting our beards grow and cutting our moustaches, following the guidance of the Prophets and Messengers, and in accordance with the fitrah. It is proven that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cTen things are part of the fitrah: cutting the moustache, letting the beard grow, cleaning the teeth with a siwaak, rinsing the nose with water, cutting one\u2019s nails, washing between the finger-joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubic hair and cleaning one\u2019s private parts with water.\u201d (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and the four authors of Sunan, from the hadeeth of \u2018Aa\u2019ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her).

The use of wigs started among non-Muslim women, who were so well known for wearing them and adorning themselves with them that this became one of their distinguishing features. If a woman wears a wig and adorns herself with it, even if she does this for her husband, she is imitating the kaafir women, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade: \u201cWhoever imitates a people is one of them.\u201d Wigs also come under the ruling about hair extensions, which is even more vehement in its prohibition: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade this practice and cursed the one who does it. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah, 5/191. Humayd ibn \u2018Abd al-Rahmaan ibn \u2018Awf reported that he heard Mu\u2019aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan at the time of Hajj, standing on the minbar and holding a piece of hair that had been seized by his guards, saying: \u201cWhere are your scholars? I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbidding this kind of thing and saying that Bani Israa\u2019eel were destroyed when their women started to use such things.\u201d Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cAllaah has cursed the woman who adds false hair and the woman who has this done, and the woman who tattoos and the women who has this done.\u201d (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5477).

        "question": "We have recently seen the spread of AIDS, which has many repercussions on society. This raises a number of questions, such as whether the person who has AIDS should be forcibly isolated from people who do not have the disease. What is the ruling on a person who deliberately transmits the disease to others? Is the person who has this disease considered to be suffering a terminal illness, because this is a factor in matters of divorce and financial transactions?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: isolation of the sick. The medical information that is currently available states that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through living with a person or touching him; it is not airborne; it is not transmitted through insects or through sharing food, drink, swimming pools, seats, eating utensils, and whatever else has to do with the ordinary details of living together day by day. The disease is primarily transferred in one of the following ways: Sexual contact, of whatever kind. Transfusion of infected blood or blood products. Using infected needles, especially among those who use drugs; using infected razors. AIDS may be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or childbirth. On the basis of the above, it is not necessary to isolate infected people from their healthy colleagues if there is no fear of them passing on the disease. The patient may be dealt with according to regular medical procedures. Secondly: deliberately transmitting the disease. Deliberately passing on AIDS to a healthy person is the deliberate commission of a haraam (forbidden) deed, and is counted as a serious major sin. It requires a punishment in this world, to be determined in accordance with the level of the crime and its impact on individuals and society as a whole. If the intention was to spread this terrible disease in society, this is counted as a kind of aggression and spreading mischief on earth, which should be met with one of the punishments referred to in the aayah: \u201cThe recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:33] If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, and this is what happens, but the person who has been infected has not yet died, the person who did this should be punished with ta\u2019zeer (a punishment to be determined by the qaadi or judge). If the infected person dies, then the matter of execution should be looked into. If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, but this does not happen, then he should be punished with ta\u2019zeer. Thirdly: considering AIDS to be a terminal illness: In sharee\u2019ah, AIDS is counted as a terminal illness once it is full-blown and the patient is no longer living a normal life and death is approaching.",
        "summary": "The aayah condemns the spread of the AIDS virus, which is transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusion, needles, and other means. In addition, the disease does not involve infection by living with or touching a person or anyone else. The narrator emphasizes that there is no need to isolate people from one another if there is any fear that they will pass on the disease; rather, the patient should be treated according to normal medical procedures. There are three ways in which the disease can be transmitted: sexually transmitted infections, transmission of the disease, or deliberately transmitting it. It is classified as a \"haraam\" sin. If he intends to deliberately infect someone, but this happens, then the person who intended to deliberately transmit the disease should be punished accordingly. If the aim is to intentionally infect a healthy person, then such a deed is considered a crime, punishable by ta'zeer. If the intention is to provoke war against Allaah, His Messenger, or do mischief on the land, then this could be considered a major sin. For example, considering AIDS a terminal illness would be a great torment.",

Al-Khallaal reported from Qutaadah from \u2018Ikrimah who said: \u201cThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to shave their heads.\u201d Al-Hasan said: \u201cThis is mutilation.\u201d Al-Athram said: \u201cI heard Abu \u2018Abd-Allaah asking about a woman who was unable to take care of her hair properly and whether she should remove her hair according to the hadeeth of Maymoonah. He asked, \u2018Why does she want to remove it?\u2019 He said, \u2018She cannot put oil on it or anything else that will make it look better, and she has a bad infestation of lice.\u2019 He said, \u2018If it is the matter of necessity, I hope that there is nothing wrong with doing so.\u2019\u201d And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "This is a mutilation of the lice that have been infestating on the skin of women who have not shaved their heads. The hadeeth, according to al-Hasan and al-Ahmad, say that there is no harm in shaving your head unless you are absolutely certain that it is a necessity. It is mutilation because if you do not shave your head, then you will be mutilated. Al-Quraadah reports from Qutabah who said that the Prophet has forbaded women to shave. Al-Hasani also says that this is mutilating.",

        "question": "A while ago, Allaah guided me and I came back to Islam, praise be to Allaah. I let my beard grow, along with two other brothers, and this sunnah reached some of my family members too. At home we were able to create an Islamic atmosphere and all the sisters in the house put on Islamic dress. We adhered to the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah as much as possible. Then there was some trouble in our country, and the people turned against those who have beards and started to harass them. They think that everyone who has a beard wants to kill people and shed their blood, but we, as Muslims, have no desire whatsoever to kill people whom our Lord has forbidden us to kill. My father, my mother and my family have started urging me to shave my beard. My mother says that my father is angry with me, but I am afraid to do anything that goes against what the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and I am afraid to commit a sin.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly, may Allaah reward you with good for following the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for calling your family to do likewise. Secondly, shaving the beard is haraam, and letting it grow is obligatory, as you know. Obedience to the Creator takes precedence over obedience to any created being, even the closest of relatives. There can be no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator, and obedience to any other created being should only be with regard to what is good (ma\u2019roof). What you describe of your father being angry and upset because you are letting your beard grow is only because he loves you and is afraid that what has happened to others may happen to you too. But what happened to others was, in most cases, because of provocation on their part, not just because they let their beards grow; it also happened to some of those who shave their beards. You must be steadfast in your adherence to the truth, and continue to let your beard grow in obedience to Allaah and in order to earn His pleasure, even if His creatures are angry. You must also avoid the sources of trouble, and put your trust in Allaah, hoping that He will provide a way out for you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): \u201c... And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish His purpose. Indeed, Allaah has set a measure for all things\u201d [al-Talaaq 65:2-3] and, \u201c...and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him. That is the Command of Allaah, which He has sent down to you, and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will remit his sins from him and will enlarge his reward.\u201d [al-Talaaq 65:5]. We advise you to honour and respect your parents, and to explain to them with all good manners and politeness why you cannot do their bidding in this case.",

It is permitted to dye the hair with henna or any other substance that will give it a reddish or yellowish colour, because it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to dye his hair with yellow. Muslim reported that Abu Bakr dyed his hair with henna and katam and that \u2018Umar used to dye his hair with henna.

Ibn \u2018Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cBe different from the polytheists; let your beards grow and trim your moustaches.\u201d According to another report: \u201cTrim your moustaches and let your beards grow.\u201d There are other hadith which convey the same meaning, which is to leave the beard as it is and let it grow long, without shaving, plucking or cutting any part of it. Ibn Hazm reported that there was scholarly consensus that it is an obligation to trim the moustache and let the beard grow. He quoted a number of ahadith as evidence, including the hadith of Ibn \u2018Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above, and the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever does not remove any of his moustache is not one of us.\u201d (Classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi). Ibn Hazm said in al-Furu\u2019: \u201cThis formula according to our colleagues [i.e., the Hanbalis] means that it is haram to shave the beard.\u201d Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \u201cThe Quran, Sunnah and ijma\u2019 (scholarly consensus) all indicate that we must differ from the unbelievers in all aspects and not imitate them, because imitating them on the outside will make us imitate them in their bad deeds and habits, and even in beliefs, which will result in befriending them in our hearts, just as loving them in our hearts will lead to imitating them on the outside. Al-Tirmidhi reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \u201cHe is not one of us who imitates people other than us. Do not imitate the Jews and Christians.\u201d According to another version: \u201cWhoever imitates a people is one of them. \u201d (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad) \u2018Umar ibn al-Khattab rejected the testimony of the person who plucked his beard. Al-Imam Ibn \u2018Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamhid: \u201cIt is forbidden to shave the beard, and no one does this except men who are effeminate\u201d i.e., those who imitate women. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a thick beard (reported by Muslim from Jabir).

Whoever does not cut his nails is going against the fitrah. The reason behind this is cleanliness and hygiene, because dirt can gather under the nails.

Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an innovation (bid\u2019ah) which goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs (al-khulafaa\u2019 al-raashidoon) and the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased with them. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cWhoever does anything that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.\u201d (For more details, please see Question # 249). Believing that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is not like the rest of humanity, and that he is light from the Light of Allaah Himself is not a correct belief, because it contradicts the Qur\u2019aan. Allaah has stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is human, and has explained what makes the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) different from the rest of mankind. He said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cSay (O Muhammad): \u2018I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your God is One God (Allaah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.\u201d [al-Kahf 18:110] Mankind, human beings, are created, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife (Hawwa/Eve), and from them both He created many men and women...\u201d [al-Nisaa\u2019 4:1] \u201cO mankind, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust, then from a nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge)...\u201d [al-Hajj 22:5] \u201cO Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, - and as one who invites to Allaah by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light.\u201d [al-Ahzaab 33:45-46] In contrast, Allaah is the First, and He has no beginning, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cHe is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him), and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.\u201d [al-Hadeed 57:3] Allaah called His Prophet \u201clight\u201d and a \u201clamp spreading light\u201d because of the guidance and light with which Allaah sent him, with which Allaah guides all those who answer his call (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... Indeed, there has come to you a light (Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) and a plain Book (this Qur\u2019aan).\u201d [al-Maa\u2019idah 5:15] Saying that he is present and watching in every place, that he is himself present at every gathering to celebrate his birthday, and that he hears what the people present are saying, is all false. There is no basis for this in either the Qur\u2019aan or the Sunnah. Calling on him and seeking his help and support is a form of major shirk which is not permitted, whether one is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or on any other created being, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... so invoke not anyone along with Allaah.\u201d [al-Junn 72:18] \u201cAnd whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allaah, any other god of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al-kaafiroon (the disbelievers) will not be successful.\u201d [al-Mu\u2019minoon 23:117] (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah, 3/4) The Muslim should follow, not innovate. He should believe in Allaah alone, call on Him alone and seek His help alone. He should not call on or seek the help of anyone else. The consequences of shirk are devastating, as it will wipe out all a person\u2019s good deeds and lead to his doom in Hell. Bid\u2019ah is a serious matter, which will cause a person\u2019s deeds to be thrown back at him, not accepted. The Muslim should love, respect, honour and obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and give his words precedence over the words of any other human being, but it is not permitted to exaggerate about him, or to raise his status above that which has been bestowed upon him by Allaah, or to call on him instead of Allaah, because this is a violation of the rights of Allaah, and involves directing acts of worship to someone other than Allaah, when they should only be directed towards Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. We ask Allaah to help us to do that which will please Him and to avoid that which will earn His wrath, and to help us to love Him and His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is forbidden to have tattoos on the body. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who adds hair extensions and the one who has this done, and the one who does tattoos and the one who has this done. A tattoo may be on the cheek or lip, or elsewhere on the body, where the skin color is changed to blue or green or black, etc. But having a tattoo does not prevent a person from performing Hajj.",
        "summary": "the narrator explains that it is forbidden for a person to have a tattoo on his or her body. It is also forbidden for someone else to do the same. The narrator also points out that there are two types of people who can get a tattoo: the one who wears hair extensions and those who does tattoos, and the ones who don't. For example, if you're going to go to the Hajj, you should definitely wear a long-sleeve shirt. Also, you shouldn't be getting a tattoo because it will make you look like a different person.",

        "question": "My husband and I wanted to know if it were permissable to take Arabic classes at a college where the classes are mixed (men-women). We understand that there is no mixing between the sexes, but confused about the definition of \"mixing\". Please tell us what is permissable, what is not and give proof",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. The meeting together, mixing, and intermingling of men and women in one place, the crowding of them together, and the revealing and exposure of women to men are prohibited by the Law of Islam (Shari'ah). These acts are prohibited because they are among the causes for fitnah (temptation or trial which implies evil consequences), the arousing of desires, and the committing of indecency and wrongdoing. Among the many proofs of prohibition of the meeting and mixing of men and women in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah are: Verse No. 53 of Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates (Interpretation of the meaning); \"...for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs...\" In explaining this Verse, Ibn Kathir (May Allah have mercy on him) said: \"Meaning, as I forbade you to enter their rooms, I forbid you to look at them at all. If one wants to take something from them, one should do so without looking at them. If one wants to ask a woman for something, the same has to be done from behind a screen.\" The Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) enforced separation of men and women even at Allah\u2019s most revered and preferred place, the mosque. This was accomplished via the separation of the women\u2019s rows from the men\u2019s; men were asked to stay in the mosque after completion of the obligatory prayer so that women will have enough time to leave the mosque; and, a special door was assigned to women. Evidence of the foregoing are: Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said that after Allah\u2019s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said \"as-Salamu \u2018Alaykum wa Rahmatullah\u2019 twice announcing the end of prayer, women would stand up and leave. He would stay for a while before leaving. Ibn Shihab said that he thought that the staying of the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) was in order for the women to be able to leave before the men who wanted to depart.\" Narrated by al-Bukhari under No. 793. Abu Dawood under No. 876 narrates the same hadith in Kitab al-Salaat under the title \"Insiraaf an-Nisaa\u2019 Qabl al-Rijaal min al-Salaah\" (Departure of Women before Men after the Prayer). Ibn \u2018Umar said that Allah\u2019s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"We should leave this door (of the mosque) for women.\" Naafi\u2019 said: \"Ibn \u2018Umar never again entered through that door until he died.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood under No. 484 in \"Kitab as-Salah\" under the Chapter entitled: \"at-Tashdid fi Thalik\". Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"\"The best of the men\u2019s rows is the first and the worst is the last, and the best of the women\u2019s rows is the last and the worst in the first.\" Narrated by Muslim under No. 664. This is the greatest evidence that the Law of Islam (Shari'ah) forbids meeting and mixing of men and women. The farther the men are from the women\u2019s rows, the better, and vice versa. If these procedures and precautions were prescribed and adhered to in a mosque, which is a pure place of worship where people are as far away as they ever are from the arousal of desire and temptation, then no doubt the same procedures need to be followed even more rigorously at other places. Abu Usayd al-Ansari narrated that he heard Allah\u2019s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) say to the women on his way out of the mosque when he saw men and women mixing together on their way home: \u2018Give way (i.e., walk to the sides) as it is not appropriate for you to walk in the middle the road.\u2019 Thereafter, women would walk so close to the wall that their dresses would get caught on it. Narrated by Abu Dawood in \"Kitab al-Adab min Sunanihi, Chapter: Mashyu an-Nisa Ma\u2019 ar-Rijal fi at-Tariq.\"We know that the intermingling, mixing and crowding together of men and women is part of today\u2019s unavoidable yet regrettable affliction in most places, such as markets, hospitals, colleges, etc., but: \u00b7 We will not willfully choose or accept mixing and crowding, particularly in religious classes and council meetings in Islamic Centers. \u00b7 We take precautions to avoid meeting and mixing of men and women as much as possible while at the same time achieving desired goals and objectives. This result can be achieved by designating separate places assigned for men and women, using different doors for each, utilizing modern means of communication such as microphones, video recorders etc., and expediting efforts to have enough female teachers to teach women, etc. \u00b7 We show fear of Allah as much as we can by not looking at members of the opposite sex and by applying self-restraint. There follow some of the results of a study on mixing undertaken by some Muslim social science researchers. When we put the following question: What is the Islamic ruling on mixing as far as you know? The results were as follows: 76% of respondents said \u201cIt is not permitted.\u201d 12% said, \u201cIt is permitted\u201d \u2013 but moral, religious, etc. restrictions apply... 12% said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Which would you choose? If you had the choice between working in a mixed workplace and working in another where there was no mixing, which would you choose? The responses to this question were as follows: 76% would choose the workplace where there was no mixing. 9% preferred the mixed workplace. 15% would accept any workplace which suited their specialties, regardless of whether it was mixed or not. Very embarrassing Have any embarrassing situations ever happened to you because of mixing? Among the embarrassing moments mentioned by respondents in this study were the following: I was at work one day, and I went into one department where one of my female colleagues who wears hijaab had taken off her hijaab in front of her female colleagues. My entrance took her by surprise and I was very embarrassed as a result. I had to do an experiment in the lab at university, but I was absent on the day of the experiment. I had to go to the lab on the following day, and I found myself the only male among a group of female students, in addition to a female teacher and a female lab technician. I was very embarrassed and felt very awkward with all those female eyes glaring at me. I was trying to take a feminine towel out of one of the drawers when I was surprised by a male colleague standing behind me, who wanted to take something from his own private drawer. He noticed that I was embarrassed and he left the room quickly to avoid my embarrassment. It so happened that one of the girls at the university bumped into me when turning a corner in a crowded corridor. She was walking quickly, going to one of the lectures. As a result of this collision, she lost her balance, and I caught her in my arms, as if I was embracing her. You can imagine how embarrassed I and this girl felt in front of a group of careless young people. One of my female colleagues fell on the stairs in the university and her clothes fell open in an extremely embarrassing fashion. She landed upside down and could not help herself; the young men standing nearby had no option but to cover her and help her to get up. I work in a company and I went in to give some papers to my boss. When I was going out, my boss called me back. I turned around and saw him with his face turned away. I was waiting for him to ask me for a file or for more papers, and I was surprised by his hesitancy. I turned away to the left side of his office, pretending to be busy with something, and he spoke to me at the same time. I thought that this boss would say anything except what he actually said, which was to point out that my garment was stained with menstrual blood. Can the earth open up and swallow a human being at the moment of making sincere supplication? For I prayed that the earth would open up and swallow me. Victims of mixing... True stories Lost hope Umm Muhammad, a mature woman over the age of 40, tells her story. I lived a life of modest means with my husband. There was never any closeness and harmony, and my husband did not have the kind of strong personality that a woman would hope for, but his good nature made me overlook the fact that I was the one who was responsible for most of the decision making in the family. My husband often used to mention the name of his friend and business partner, and he would talk about him in my presence, and I often used to meet with him in his office which was originally part of our apartment. This went on for many years, until circumstances led to us exchanging visits with this person and his family. These family visits were repeated and because of his close friendship with my husband, we did not notice how the number of visits increased and how many hours a single visit would last. He often used to come on his own to sit with us, me and my husband, for long visits. My husband\u2019s trust in him knew no bounds, and as days passed I got to know this person very well, and saw how wonderful and decent he was. I began to feel a strong attraction towards this man, and at the same time I began to sense that the feeling was mutual. Things took a strange turn after that, when I realized that this man was the kind of person I had always dreamed about. Why had he come along now, after all these years? The more this man\u2019s status increased in my eyes, the more my husband\u2019s status diminished. It was as if I had needed to see the beauty of his character in order to discover how ugly my husband\u2019s character was. The matter between this person and myself did not go beyond these persistent thoughts which were occupying my mind night and day. Neither he nor I ever voiced what we felt in our hearts... until today. Yet despite that my life is over and my husband is little more than a weak man with no self-esteem. I hate him and I do not know how all this hatred towards him started to boil over. I wonder how I put up with him all these years, bearing all these burdens by myself, facing life\u2019s problems on my own. Things got so bad that I asked him for a divorce, and he divorced me at my request. After that he became a broken man. Even worse than that is that after my marriage was wrecked and my children and husband were devastated, problems arose in this man's family. His wife, with her feminine intuition, realized what had been going on in his heart of hearts, and his life became hell. She was overwhelmed with jealousy to the extent that one night she left her house at 2 a.m. and came to attack my house, screaming, weeping and hurling accusations. His marriage was also about to collapse. I admit that the lovely gatherings which we used to enjoy gave us the opportunity to get to know one another at a time that was not appropriate at this stage in our lives. His marriage has been wrecked and so has mine. I have lost everything, and now I know that my circumstances and his will not permit us to take any positive step towards coming together. Now I am more miserable than I have ever been, and I am looking for illusionary happiness and lost hopes. Tit-for-tat Umm Ahmad tells us: My husband had a group of married friends, and because of our close friendship with them, we used to get together with them once a week in one of our houses, to enjoy an evening of chat. Deep down in my heart I was never really comfortable with the atmosphere in which we would have dinner, sweets, snacks and drinks of juice accompanied by waves of laughter because of the jokes and chit-chats that often went beyond the bounds of good manners. In the name of friendship, the barriers were lifted and every now and then one would hear suppressed laughter between a woman and the husband of another woman. The jokes were too much, dealing \u2013 with no sense of shyness \u2013with sensitive topics such as sex and women\u2019s private matters. This was usual and was even accepted and regarded as desirable. Although I indulged in these things along with them, my conscience made me feel guilty. Then the day came when it became quite clear just how ugly and filthy this atmosphere was. The telephone rang, and I heard the voice of one of the friends in this group. I said hello to him and apologized that my husband was not home. He replied that he knew that, and that he was calling to speak to me! After he suggested starting a relationship with me, I got very angry and spoke harshly to him and cursed him. All he could do was laugh and say, \u201cDon\u2019t try and show these good manners to me; go and check on your husband\u2019s good manners and see what he is doing...\u201d I was devastated by what he said, but I pulled myself together and said to myself, this person is only trying to cause the break up of your marriage. But he succeeded in planting the seeds of doubt concerning my husband. Shortly after that, the major disaster struck. I discovered that my husband was cheating on me with another woman. It was the matter of life or death as far as I was concerned. I found my husband out and I confronted him, saying: \u201cYou are not the only one who can have a relationship. I have received a similar proposition.\u201d And I told him all about his friend. He was stunned and absolutely shocked. (I said:) \u201cIf you want me to respond in kind to your relationship with that woman, then this is for that, tit-for-tat.\u201d This was a huge slap in the face for him. He knew that I did not intend to do that in reality, but he realized the great disaster that had befallen our lives and the immoral atmosphere in which we were living. I suffered a great deal until my husband finally left that loose woman with whom he was having a relationship, as he admitted to me. Yes, he left her and came back to his family and children, but how can I ever feel the same towards him as I used to? Who will restore respect for him in my heart? This huge wound in my heart is still bleeding out of regret and rage at that filthy atmosphere; it still bears testimony to the fact that what they call innocent get-togethers are in reality anything but innocent. My heart still begs for mercy from the Lord of Glory. Intelligence can also be a temptation (fitnah) \u2018Abd al-Fattaah says: I work as the head of department in one of the big companies. For a long time I admired one of my female colleagues, not for her beauty, but for her serious attitude towards her work, her intelligence and her excellent achievements \u2013 in addition to the fact that she was a decent and modest person who focused only on her work. This admiration turned into attachment, and I am a married man who fears Allah and never misses any obligatory prayer. I expressed my feelings to her and she rebuffed me. She is married and has children as well. She sees no reason why I should have any kind of relationship with her, whether it be friendship, as work colleagues or based on admiration... etc. Evil thoughts come to me sometimes, and deep down I wish that her husband would divorce her so that I could get her. I started to put pressure on her at work and put her down in front of my bosses. Perhaps this was a form of revenge on my part, but she accepted it with good manners and did not complain or comment. She works and works; her performance speaks of her quality, and she knows this well. The more she resisted me, the stronger my infatuation grew. I am not a person who is easily tempted by women, because I fear Allah and I do not overstep the mark with them and go beyond what is required by my work. But this woman attracted me. What is the solution?... I do not know. Baby ducks know how to swim N.A.A., a nineteen-year-old girl, tells us: At that time I was a little girl. My innocent eyes watched those evening get-togethers when family friends would meet in the house. What I remember is that I could only see one man, who was my father. I watched him as he moved about the room, how his glances would devour the women present, looking at their thighs and chests, admiring this one\u2019s eyes, that one\u2019s hair, the other\u2019s hips. My poor mother had no choice but to take care of these get-togethers. She was a very simple lady. Among the women present there was one woman who would deliberately try to attract my father\u2019s attention, sometimes by coming close to him, and sometimes by making enticing movements. I would watch this with concern, whilst my mother was busy in the kitchen for the sake of her guests. These gatherings stopped suddenly and I tried, young as I was, to understand and make sense of what had happened, but I could not. What I remember was that my mother collapsed completely at that time, and she could not stand to hear my father\u2019s name mentioned in the house. I used to hear mysterious words whispered by the adults around me: \u201cBetrayal... bedroom... she saw them with her own eyes... despicable woman... in a very shameful position...\u201d etc. These were the key words which only the adults could understand. I grew up and came to understand, and I bore a grudge against all men. All of them were treacherous. My mother was a broken woman and accused every woman who came to us of being a man-snatcher who wanted to make my father fall into her trap. My father hasn\u2019t changed. He is still practising his favourite hobby of chasing women, but now he does it outside the home. Now I am nineteen years old and I know lots of young men. I feel great pleasure in taking revenge on them, because every one of them is an exact copy of my father. I tempt them and entice them, without letting them get anywhere near me. They follow me in gatherings and in the marketplaces because of my movements and deliberate gestures. Sometimes my phone never stops ringing and I feel proud of what I do to avenge the sex of Hawwa\u2019 and my mother. But sometimes I feel so miserable and such a failure that it almost chokes me. My life is shadowed by a huge dark cloud, and its name is my father. Before it is too late S.N.A. tells of her experience: I never imagined that my work circumstances would force me to be in contact with the opposite sex (men), but this in fact is what happened... In the beginning, I used to cover and screen myself from men by wearing niqaab (face-veil), but some of the sisters advised me that this dress was attracting more attention to my presence, and it would be better for me to take off the niqaab, especially since my eyes were somewhat attractive. So I removed the cover from my face, thinking that this was better. But by continuing to mix with my colleagues, I discovered that I was the odd one out because of my antisocial attitude and my insistence on not joining in the conversation and chatting with others. Everyone was wary of this \u201clone-wolf\u201d woman (as they saw me), and this is what was stated clearly by one person who affirmed that he would not want to deal with such a snooty and stand-offish character. But I knew that I was the opposite, in fact, and I decided that I would not oppress myself and put myself in a difficult position with my colleagues. So I started to join in their chats and exchanges of anecdotes, and they all discovered that I could speak eloquently and persuasively, and that I could influence others. I could also speak in a manner that was determined yet at the same time was attractive to some of my colleagues. It was not long before I noticed some changes in the expression of my direct supervisor; with some embarrassment, he was enjoying the way I spoke and moved, and he would deliberately bring up topics in the conversation where I would see that hateful look in his eyes. I do not deny the fact that I started to entertain some thoughts about this man. I found it astonishing that a man could fall so easily into the trap of a woman who was religiously committed, so how must it be in the case of women who adorn themselves and invite men to commit immoral actions? In fact, I did not think of him in any way which went beyond the bounds of sharee\u2019ah, but he did occupy a space in my thoughts for quite some time. But soon my self-respect made me reject the idea of being a source of enjoyment for this man in any way, shape or form, even if it was only psychological in nature, and I stopped getting involved in any kind of work that would force me to sit alone with him. In the end, I reached the following conclusions: 1- Attraction between the sexes can occur in any circumstances, no matter how much men and women may deny that. The attraction may start within the bounds of sharee\u2019ah and end up going beyond those bounds. Even if a person protects himself (by marriage), he is not safe from the snares of the Shaytaan. 3- Even though a person may be able to guarantee himself and he works with the opposite sex within reasonable limits, he cannot guarantee the feelings of the other party. Finally, there is nothing good in mixing and it does not bear fruit as they claim. On the contrary, it corrupts sound thinking. What now? We may ask, what comes next, after this discussion on the matter of mixing? It\u2019s about time for us to recognize that no matter how we try to beautify the issue of mixing and take the matter lightly, its consequences are bound to catch up with us, and the harm it causes will have disastrous results for our families. Sound common sense refuses to accept that mixing is a healthy atmosphere for human relations. This is the sound common sense which made most of the people included in this survey (76%) prefer working in a non-mixed environment. The same percentage (76%) said that mixing is not permitted according to the sharee\u2019ah. What makes us sit up and take notice is not this honourable percentage \u2013 which indicates the purity of our Islamic society and the cleanness of its members\u2019 hearts \u2013 but the small number who said that mixing is permitted; they number 12%. This group, with no exceptions, said that mixing is permitted but within the limits set by religion, custom (\u2018urf), traditions, good manners, conscience, modesty, covering and other worthy values which, in their opinion, keep mixing within proper limits. We ask them: is the mixing which we see nowadays in our universities, market-places, work-places and family and social gatherings, taking place within the limits referred to above? Or are these places filled with transgressions in terms of clothing, speech, interactions and behaviour? We see wanton displays of adornment (tabarruj), not proper covering; we see fitnah (temptations) and dubious relationships, with no good manners and no conscience and no covering. We can conclude that the kind of mixing that is happening nowadays is unacceptable even to those who approve of mixing in a clean atmosphere. It\u2019s about time for us to recognize that mixing provides a fertile breeding-ground for social poisons to invade and take over our society without anyone ever realizing that it is mixing which is the cause. Mixing is the prime element in this silent fitnah, in the shade of which betrayals erupt, homes are wrecked and hearts are broken. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and to reform our society. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",
        "summary": "Prologue to Tahrir al-Sheikh explains how he manages to avoid mixing with men and women by separating the women's rows from those of men. In order to achieve this goal, he sets up separate places for both genders in the mosque. He also makes sure that all his female colleagues are allowed to leave the room at once. Teta-Tat Umm Al-Ahmad tells us that she used to have a close relationship with a married friend who would often visit her apartment during the day. However, after one visit, she realized that her husband was hooking up with someone else. Thus, she began to fall in love with him. She even tried to start a relationship with him, only to have him divorce her at the last minute. After this incident, she decided to take revenge on the people who had made such an immoral relationship between her and her husband. She now works as a social worker in a large company where she has a close association with many young men. She is nineteen years old when she tells them about her story.\nThe narrator realizes that he is the odd one-out because of his \" antisocial attitude\" and his refusal to join in the conversation with his colleagues. He notices a change in his supervisor's expression, and soon he starts to enjoy the way she speaks and moves, and he begins to see this hateful look in her eyes. The narrator feels guilty for being such a hateful person, but he does not want to be associated with someone who is religiously committed. In the meantime, the narrator sees some changes in his direct supervisor, who enjoys the way he talks and moves. Soon, however, he stops joining in the conversations and chit-chat with others.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible to fulfil the vow from the property of the orphans. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd come not near to the orphan\u2019s property, except to improve it\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:152] If we pay this from the orphan\u2019s property, there is no benefit to the orphan, rather taking it is counted as stealing. Everyone who is in charge of orphans\u2019 property has to dispose of it in the manner which he thinks is in the orphans\u2019 best interests. With regard to that which is not in their interests, or which serves some interest but there is some doubt as to whether it is in their best interests, then it is not permissible to dispose of it in that manner, because of the quotation mentioned (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd come not near to the orphan\u2019s property, except to improve it\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:152] So it is not permissible dispose of it, even if they are her children.",

        "question": "There is a big dispute among Muslim scholars concerning the timing of the beginning of Ramadaan and \u2018Eid al-Fitr. Some of them act upon the sighting of the new moon, because of the hadeeth, \u201cFast when you sight it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you sight it...\u201d; others rely on the calculations of astronomers, saying that these scientists have progressed so far in the science of astronomy that they are able to know when the lunar month begins. Who is right in this matter?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the correct opinion which must be acted upon is that indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \u201cFast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.\u201d That is the basis for determining the beginning and end of Ramadaan by the actual sighting of the new moon. The Islamic sharee\u2019ah with which Allaah sent our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is universal and everlasting, until the Day of Resurrection. (It is valid for every time and place, whether worldly sciences are advanced or otherwise, whether there are telescopes etc. or not, whether there are any people in the population who are able to do astronomical calculations or not. Sighting the moon is something that people of all places and times can do, unlike calculations which may or may not be within the reach of the people, and telescopes which may or may not be available) Secondly: Allaah knew what progress would be made in astronomy and other sciences, but despite that He still said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201c... So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month...\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:185] and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cFast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it...\u201d So the beginning and ending of Ramadaan are connected to the actual sighting of the moon, and not to the calculations of astronomers, even though Allaah knew that the astronomers would develop their science to the point where they would be able to calculate the positions of the stars and heavenly bodies. The Muslims are obliged to follow what Allaah has prescribed for them through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), basing the beginning and end of the fast on the sighting of the moon. This is like the consensus of the scholars, whoever differs with this and relies on calculations is shaadhdh (\u201codd\u201d) and his opinion cannot be relied on. And Allaah knows best.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.This extra fee that you are charging for late payments from the purchaser is the essence of ribaa. Hence when Allaah stated that the ribaa which the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to charge when the debtor delayed payment, when they would charge the debtor more in return for a respite, was forbidden, He commanded that the debtor should be given a respite without further charges being made. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:280] And Allaah knows best.",

        "question": "What is The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.There are two aspects to the answer to this question: general and specific. The general answer is that the Muslim believes that Allaah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, and He does not create anything in vain; all of His actions are based on Wisdom. If the wisdom behind any of His actions is hidden from the believer, then he should still adhere to this principle, and not think of his Lord in bad terms. The specific answer is that the wisdom behind the creation of these things is to manifest the perfect nature of Allaah\u2019s creation and control of all things. Even though the created things are so many, He provides for them all. He also tests people by means of these (dangerous creatures), rewards those who are afflicted by them and makes manifest the bravery of those who kill them. By creating them, He tests His slaves\u2019 faith and certainty: the believer accepts the matter and submits, whilst the doubter says, \u201cWhat is the point of Allaah creating this?!\u201d He also demonstrates the weakness and incapability of man, whereby he suffers pain and sickness because of a creature which is far smaller than he is. One of the scholars was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of flies. He said, so that Allaah may humiliate the noses of the tyrants with them. Because of the existence of harmful creatures, it becomes apparent how great is the blessing in the creation of beneficial things, as it is said that contrast with the opposite demonstrates the nature of things. The study of medicine has demonstrated that many beneficial drugs are derived from the venom of snakes and the like. Glory be to the One Who has created benefits in things that to all outward appearances are harmful. Moreover, many of these dangerous animals are food for other creatures which are beneficial, and this forms the ecological cycle in the environments where Allaah has created them. But the Muslim has to believe that everything that Allaah does is good, and that there is no pure evil in what He creates. In everything that He creates there has to be some aspect of good, even if it is hidden from us, as is the case with the creation of Iblees, who is the head of evil. But there is wisdom and a purpose behind his creation, for Allaah tests His creatures by means of him, to distinguish the obedient from the disobedient, those who strive from those who are negligent, the people of Paradise from the people of Hell. We ask Allaah to bless us with strength of faith and understanding of our religion. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.",

Who is considered to have received the message? ii. Isn't it possible for people to have not received the message even though the Quran is in existence?'",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is part of the justice of Allah that He does not punish any people until He has first sent a warning to them and unless there is evidence against them. Allah does not treat anybody unfairly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning). [al-Israa 17:15]. In his tafseer (commentary) on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: These words, And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning) tell us of the justice of Allah, may He be exalted, and that He does not punish anyone until after He has established evidence against him by sending a Messenger to him. This is like the aayat (interpretation of the meaning): Every time a group is cast therein [into Hell], its keeper will ask, Did no warner come to you? They will say, Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error. [al-Mulk 67:8] and: And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of its prisoners). And its keepers will say, Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours? They will say: Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers! [al-Zumar 39:71] A person who has never heard of Islam or the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and who has never heard the message in its correct and true form, will not be punished by Allah if he dies in a state of kufr (disbelief). If it were asked what his fate will be, the answer will be that Allah will test him on the Day of Resurrection: if he obeys, he will enter Paradise and if he disobeys he will enter Hell. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of al-Aswad ibn Saree, who reported that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are four (who will protest) to Allah on the Day of Resurrection: the deaf man who never heard anything, the insane man, the very old man, and the man who died during the fatrah (the interval between the time of Eesaa (Jesus, upon whom be peace) and the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). The deaf man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything. The insane man will say, O Lord, Islam came but the children ran after me and threw stones at me. The very old man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I did not understand anything. The man who died during the fatrah will say, O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me. He will accept their promises of obedience, then word will be sent to them to enter the Fire. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them. According to another report, he said: Whoever enters it, it will be cool and safe for him, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged to it. (The hadeeth was reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan, and deemed saheeh by al-Albaani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 881). Everyone who hears the message of Islam in a sound and correct form (and rejects it), will have evidence against him. Whoever dies without having heard the message, or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the hands of Allah. Allah knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly. And Allah is All-Seer of His slaves.",

        "question": "It is not possible to see the new moon with the naked eye before it is 30 hours old, and in addition to that, it is sometimes not possible to see it at all because of the weather conditions. On this basis, is it permissible to resort to using astronomical information to calculate the likely time for sighting the new moon and the start of Ramadaan, or do we have to actually sight the new moon before we start fasting the blessed month of Ramadaan?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to use telescopes etc. to sight the moon, but it is not permissible to rely on astronomical data to confirm the beginning or end of the blessed month of Ramadaan, because Allaah has not prescribed that for us in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What He has prescribed for us is to confirm the beginning and end of Ramadaan by sighting the new moon of Ramadaan to start fasting, and the new moon of Shawwaal to end the fast and gather to offer the Eid prayers. Allaah has made the new moons to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj, so it is not permissible for Muslims to use any other method to determine the times for acts of worship such as fasting, celebrating Eid, performing Hajj, fasting for two months as expiation (kafaarah) for killing someone by mistake or divorcing one\u2019s wife by zihaar, and so on. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): \u201c... So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month...\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:185] \u201cThey ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage...\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:189] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cFast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.\u201d On this basis, the one who does not see the new moon from the time it rises on a clear or cloudy night must complete the month (of Sha\u2019baan) with thirty days. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah, 10/100).

We should all begin our fast at the same time regardless of where we live. We are students in the U.S. and Canada, and we face the same problem every year at the beginning of Ramadaan, because the Muslims are split into three groups:A group that fasts when the new moon is sighted in the city in which they live. A group that fasts when fasting starts in Saudi Arabia. A group that fasts when they hear news from the Muslim students\u2019 union in the U.S. and Canada which watches for the new moon in different parts of America, and as soon as the new moon is sighted in one city, they spread the news to different Islamic centres so that the Muslims in America can start fasting on the same day, despite the great distances between the different cities. Which group should we follow? Whose sighting of the moon should we rely on? Please give us a fatwa, may Allaah reward you.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the fact that the moon rises at different times in different places is a well-established fact; no scholar disputes this. However, the scholars differ as to whether this matters or not. Secondly: the question as to whether different times of moonrise is something that matters is a theoretical question in which ijtihaad is permissible. Those who have knowledge of science and religion differ on this matter, and this difference of opinion is permissible; the one who has the correct opinion will have two rewards, one for being right and one for making ijtihaad; the one whose opinion is wrong will still be rewarded for his ijtihaad. The scholars\u2019 differences on this matter may be described as one of two: some of them thought that the differences in the times of the moon\u2019s rising was of significance, and others thought that it was not. Both groups cite evidence from the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, and maybe even quote the same text, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cThey ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage...\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:189] and the hadeeth, \u201cFast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it...\u201d The difference is one of interpretation of the texts, as each group has its own methods of deriving evidence. Thirdly: the committee has looked at the issue of confirming the new moon by calculations and what was said on this matter in the Qur\u2019aan and Sunnah, and they have studied the opinions of the scholars on this matter. They decided unanimously that astronomical calculations do not count when it comes to confirming the new moon for shar'i purposes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cFast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it...\u201d and also: \u201cDo not fast until you see it [the new moon] and do not stop fasting until you see it...\u201d, and because of the evidence that is derived from these ahaadeeth. The Standing Committee on Scientific Research and Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daa\u2019imah li\u2019l-Buhooth al-\u2018Ilmiyyah wa\u2019l-Iftaa\u2019) thinks that the Muslim students\u2019 union (or any other group representing the Muslim community) in countries where the government is not Islamic should take the place of an Islamic government in the matter of confirming the new moon for the people living in those non-Islamic countries. On the basis of the above, this union has the choice of two options: either to consider the differences in times of moonrise to be of significance, or not to do so. Then they should inform all the Muslims in their country what their opinion is, and the Muslims have to follow what they have been told, so as to unite the Muslims in their fasting and to put an end to disputes and confusion. Everyone who lives in those countries should try to sight the moon in the place where they are living, and if one or more trustworthy persons sight the moon, they should fast according to that and tell the union to spread the news. This is at the beginning of Ramadaan; at the end of the month there has to be two witnesses to see the new moon of Shawwaal or the completion of thirty days of Ramadaan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cFast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.\u201d And Allaah knows best.",

Allah will grant him rain, the earth will bring forth its fruits, he will give a lot of money, cattle will increase and the ummah will become great. He will rule for seven or eight years. (Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557-558; he said: this is a hadith whose isnaad is saheeh, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and al-Albaani said: this is a saheeh sanad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), Silsilat al-ahaadeeth al-saheehah, vol. 2, p. 336, hadith 771) 2. Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is one of us, a member of my family. Allah will guide him in a single night.\" (Musnad Ahmad, 2/58, hadith 645, edited by Ahmad al-Shaakir, who said: its isnaad is saheeh; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/1367. This hadith was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 6735). Ibn Katheer said: \"This means that Allah will forgive him, grant him help, inspire him and guide him, when he was not like this before.\" (Al-Nihaayah, al-Fitan wal-Malaahim, 1/29; edited by Taha Zayni). 3. Abu Saeed al-Khudri said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is of my lineage, with a high forehead and a long, thin, curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years.\" (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Mahdi, 11/375, hadith 4265; Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557; he said: this is a saheeh hadith according to the conditions of Muslim, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. See also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6736). 4. Umm Salamah said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) say: The Mahdi is of my lineage and family, from the descendants of Faatimah.\" (Sunan Abu Dawud, 11/373; Sunan Ibn Maajah. 2/1368. Al-Albaani said that it is saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami, 6734) 5. Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader the Mahdi will say, \"Come and lead us in prayer,\" but he will say, \"No, one of them should lead them as an honour to this ummah from Allah.\"\" The version narrated by Muslim says: \" Then Eesaa ibn Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say, Come and lead us in prayer, but he will say, No, some of you are leaders over others as an honour from Allah to this ummah.\" (Reported by Muslim, 225) 6. Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"He is one of us, behind whom Eesaa ibn Maryam will pray.\" (Reported by Abi Naeem in Akhbaar al-Mahdi. Al-Albaani said it is saheeh; see al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 5/219, hadith 5796). 7. Abdullaah ibn Masood reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"The world will not come to an end until the Arabs are ruled by a man from my family whose name will be the same as mine.\" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/199, hadith 3573. Another version says: \" whose name is the same as mine and whose fathers name is the same as my fathers.\" Sunan Abi Dawud, 11/370). The ahaadeeth concerning the appearance of the Mahdi reach the level of Tawaatur in meaning (tawaatur refers to a hadith which was narrated by so many people through so many isnaads that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). The imaams and scholars of this ummah have stated this, and a few of their comments are quoted below: 1.

They state that the Mahdi will be of his family, that he will rule for seven years, that he will fill the earth with justice, that Eesaa ibn Maryam will emerge and help him to kill the Dajjaal, and that he will lead this ummah in prayer and Eesaa will pray behind him.\" 2. Muhammad al-Barzanji said, in his book al-Ishaaah li Ashraat al-Saaah: \"The major signs and the signs that will be immediately followed by the Hour: these signs are many, of which the Mahdi will be the first. Know that the ahaadeeth that have been narrated about him in various reports are numerous.\" He also said: \"You know that the ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi, his appearance at the end of time, and his lineage and descent from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) via Faatimah reach the level of tawaatur in meaning, so there is no point in denying them.\" 3. Al-Allaamah Muhammad al-Safaareeni said: \"There are so many reports which speak of the appearance of the Mahdi that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning; they are very popular among the scholars of Sunnah and have become part of their faith.\" Then he quotes a number of ahaadeeth and reports about the appearance of the Mahdi and the names of the Sahaabah from whom they were narrated: \"Many reports were narrated from the Sahaabah whose names were mentioned and others whose names were not mentioned, may Allah be pleased with them all, and from the Taabieen after them, all of which proves that this is definitive knowledge. Belief in the appearance of the Mahdi is obligatory, as it has been confirmed by the scholars and is listed among the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah.\" 4. Al-Allaamah al-Mujtahid al-Shawkaani said: \"The ahaadeeth that we have come across that speak of the awaited Mahdi reach the level of tawaatur, including fifty saheeh, hasan and daeef munjabar ahaadeeth. There are mutawaatir without a doubt; indeed they are more mutawaatir than others, according to all the standards of usool. There are also many reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi and that reach the level of marfoo, so there is no room for individual opinions in such an issue.\" 5. Al-Allaamah al-Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khaan said: \"Even though there are different versions of reports concerning the Mahdi, they are so many that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning. They are to be found in al-Sunan and other books of Islam.\" 6. Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Jafar al-Kattaani said: \"The conclusion is that the ahaadeeth narrated concerning the Mahdi are mutawaatir, as are the ahaadeeth concerning the Dajjaal and the descent of Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace.\" (See Ashraat al-Saaah by Yoosuf ibn Abdullaah al-Waabil, pp. 195-203). You should be aware that some liars have fabricated ahaadeeth about the Mahdi, and others have even claimed to be he, or that he belongs to a group other than Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. Some of these \"false mahdis\" have tried to deceive the slaves of Allah for some worldly gain and to distort the picture of Islaam. Some have started movements and revolutions and gathered those people and supporters whom they were able to deceive. Then they were destroyed, and their lies and falsehood were exposed. None of this affects the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah in the Mahdi, upon whom be peace, and that he will undoubtedly appear and rule the earth in accordance with Islamic Shareeah. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. There are ahaedaeth indicating that the \"Mahdi\" will appear at an end of his ummah. This means that he will grant rain, bring forth fruits, and increase the income of the Ummah for seven years. It also means that the earth will be full of fairness and justice during this period. According to al-Ahmad, this means that there will be no more oppression or injustice in the future.",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. If your imaam shaves his beard, then you should advise him to let it grow, in adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). If he refuses, then ask someone else who can recite Qur'aan well, even if he has not memorized as much or does not have as beautiful a voice. If you cannot find anyone but this man who can recite well, then let him lead the prayers, but keep advising him. May Allaah guide him to follow the sunnah and become a leader who sets the right example. One of the scholars was asked the following question: We are led in prayer by a man who shaves his beard. Are we permitted to pray behind him or not? He answered: If this man who shaves his beard is the official permanent imaam in a mosque, you should try to replace him with someone better, and look for someone who is righteous and qualified, and free of this sin, who could be appointed as the imaam. If he is an imaam who always leads the prayers in an office or school, leading zuhr prayers during work hours, then first of all you should advise him of how abhorrent his action is. If he then persists, then try to find someone else who does not have this fault, even if he is less skilled in recitation. But if this is a situation where he is leading the prayers only once, then there is nothing wrong with praying behind him if he goes forward to lead the prayer and you cannot find anyone better than him. In general, such a prayer should be good enough, in sha Allaah, but you should know that you have to advise him and every other Muslim who falls into the error of committing this sin or others. And Allaah knows best. (Fataawa Islaamiyyah, 1/393) A pregnant woman is excused from fasting, and all she has to do is make up the fast later on.

Can I test my blood during fasting times; \"causing blood to come from my fingers\"?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Can sick people break the fast? It is prescribed for sick people not to fast in Ramadan, if fasting will cause harm or make the sickness worse, or if they need treatment during the day in the form of medicine or pills that must be swallowed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days\u201d [al-Baqarah 2:185] Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \u201cAllah loves people to avail themselves of His concessions (rukhsah) just as He hates them to commit sin.\u201d According to another version, \u201cAs He loves His commands to be obeyed.\u201d Can we check sugar during fasting? With regard to taking blood from veins for testing etc., the correct view is that this does not break the fast, but if it is done often, it is better to leave it until night-time. If it is done during the day then to be on the safe side that day should be made up, because this is akin to cupping.\u201d (Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), from Fatawa Islamiyyah, vol. 2, p. 139) Can diabetics fast? Sickness is of various kinds: That which does not affect the fast, such as a light cold or mild headache or toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible to break the fast, even though some of the scholars permitted that because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cand whoever is ill...\u201d[al-Baqarah 2:185] But we say that this ruling is based on a reason, which is that not fasting is easier. If that is the case, then we would say that not fasting is better, but if fasting does not have an effect on him then it is not permissible to break the fast, and he has to fast. If fasting is difficult for the sick person, but it does not harm him, then it is makruh for him to fast and it is Sunnah for him to break his fast. If fasting is difficult for him and will cause him harm, such as a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and similar cases where fasting will cause harm. In this case fasting is haram. Hence we may see that some mujtahids and sick people make a mistake when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they refuse to break their fast. We say that they are mistaken because they refuse to accept the kindness of Allah and the concession that He has given to them, and they are harming themselves, although Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd do not kill yourselves\u201d[al-Nisa 4:29] (Al-Sharh al-Mumti\u2019 by Shaykh Ibn \u2018Uthaymin, vol. 6, 352-254) And Allah knows best.",

        "question": "A woman sees some liquids (yellow color) in her underware while she is not in period. This frequently happens to her and causes a real difficulty for praying specially out side the home and as you know women in this country go out of their home frequently. What is the judgment on these liquids (pure or inpure) and should she change the underwar every time!? and What is the status of her wudu?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah. What is well-known is that the scholars say that everything that is discharged from the front and back passages is naajis (impure) except for one thing, semen, which is taahir (pure); apart from that everything else that has substance is naajis and breaks one\u2019s wudoo\u2019. On this basis, whatever fluid comes out of a woman is naajis and requires her to renew her wudoo\u2019. This is what I understand after researching the issue with some scholars and consulting reference material. However, I did not feel entirely comfortable about this issue, because some women always have this discharge; if this is the case, then she should handle it as incontinence is handled: if she has wudoo\u2019 she should wash her private parts when the time for prayer comes, and be careful not to let the urine contaminate her. This is similar to the advice that the Prophet gave to the woman suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding). Having also discussed the matter with some doctors, it is clear that if the discharge is from the bladder, the woman should do as described above; if it is from the vagina then she must perform wudoo\u2019 because of it, but the discharge is taahir and she does not have to wash her clothes if it gets on them.",

Twenty-five riyaals are collected from each person and the money is given to the family of the deceased. We slaughter a sheep or similar animal three days after the death.

With regard to reciting Qur\u2019aan over the grave of the deceased, this is not permissible, and none of the Salaf did this. If it were good to do this, they would have done it before us. It has been reported that Soorat Yaa-Seen should be recited for the person who is dying, before his soul departs, but after he has died and when he is being buried and after the burial, there is nothing that should be recited, and one should not tell him to say \u201cLaa ilaaha ill-Allaah\u201d and so on. Offering condolences is Sunnah, but it need not be during the mourning ceremonies. Condolences may be offered to the family of the deceased in all places. There is nothing wrong with all the relatives of the deceased gathering together in one place so that people may come and offer their condolences, but they should not gather for the purpose of eating. Food should be prepared only for the immediate family of the deceased; it is makrooh for them to offer food to others. There is no need to gather this money from everyone, unless the family are poor, in which case they may be given zakaat funds. It is not permissible to slaughter this sheep, whether it is from the wealth of the deceased or from someone else. But if food is prepared for the family of the deceased, from one or more animals, there is nothing wrong with this. Collecting these pebbles, and making dhikr whilst doing so, and putting them on the grave \u2013 this is a reprehensible innovation (bid\u2019ah) which must be given up and denounced. Raising one\u2019s voice in wailing and lamenting, striking the cheeks and eulogizing the deceased are all bid\u2019ah and actions of the jaahiliyyah. It was reported in a hadeeth: \u201cHe is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and calls with the call of the jaahiliyyah.\u201d (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1294, Fath 3/163; Muslim, 103; Ahmad, 1/244). Wearing black as a sign of mourning for the deceased is bid\u2019ah; but the wives of the deceased should avoid wearing fancy or adorned clothes, jewellery, makeup and perfume during their period of mourning. It is bid\u2019ah for women to avoid their usual work and activities; the newly-widowed woman can still prepare food, clean the house, wash the dishes, do laundry, etc. There is nothing wrong with her doing that.

        "question": "I would like to ask you if wearing perfume such as CK Eternity, or Aramis which contains Alcohol SD, or Alcohol denat.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.We need to talk at length about the issue of perfumes that are said to contain cologne or alcohol. If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very little, we say that it does not matter, and a person may use them without any concern, such as if the alcohol content is 5% or less. This does not matter. If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very high, so that you can detect it, then it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds and the like. In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do not say that it is haram. The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible? This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytan\u2019s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?\u201d [al-Maidah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase \u2018So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. If we look at the reason why, Allah says, \u201cShaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So will you not then abstain?\u201d We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden, because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.). So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentage of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like. And Allah knows best.",
        "summary": "we delve deeper into the subject of alcohol and why it is considered an abomination. In particular, we focus on the issue of perfume that contains a high percentage of alcohol. The scholars argue that there is no way to detect alcohol in a perfume because it does not contain alcohol at all.

        "question": "I have heard that there are ahaadeeth which indicate that it is allowed to recite the Qur\u2019aan in a melodious voice (taghanni). How are we to understand these ahaadeeth?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Reciting in a melodious voice (taghanni) may mean: 1 \u2013 Making the voice beautiful when reciting, whilst reciting aloud in a tone that conveys the feelings of humility, softening of the heart and sadness, without making too much effort or exaggerating. Taghanni means reciting aloud, as it was narrated in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said: \u201cThe Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah does not listen to anything (more approvingly) than He listens to a Prophet reciting the Qur\u2019aan aloud in a melodious voice...\u201d This indicates that we are commanded and encouraged to make our voices beautiful when reciting Qur\u2019aan. This hadeeth clearly states the meaning of taghanni. The phrase \u201creciting aloud\u201d explains it. Reciting aloud means raising one\u2019s voice when reciting and making it beautiful, in a natural manner with no artifice, which one enjoys and finds pleasure in. Before the Qur\u2019aan was revealed, the Arabs used to sing hudaa\u2019 (songs of camel drivers) when riding camels, to make the journey pass more quickly when they were sitting in their saddles, and so on. But when the Qur\u2019aan was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to make them focus on the Qur\u2019aan and raise their voices and make them beautiful when reciting it. He wanted that to take the place of singing, whilst paying attention to the correctness of the recitation. So in place of the pleasure of singing, they were given the pleasure of reciting Qur\u2019aan, just as everything forbidden was replaced with something that was better for them. So istikhaarah was prescribed in place of seeking decisions from azlaam (arrows for divination) and marriage in place of fornication, and so on. 2 \u2013 It may be that what is meant by taghanni is that which resembles singing and music, and impressing others with the tune, without understanding and without any humility, as mentioned in the hadeeth which describes the Signs of the Hour. 3 \u2013 It is unlikely that taghanni means being content with the Qur\u2019aan alone and having no need of people, because the meaning is different and is linguistically unacceptable. This making the voice melodious in recitation should be done in a natural manner, not by means of teaching and training according to the rules of music. Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned that reciting Qur\u2019aan with a tune and in a melodious voice, if it is done naturally with no exaggeration or special teaching or training, then it is permissible. If extra effort is added to the natural tone to make it more beautiful, such as when Abu Moosa al-Ash\u2019ari said to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \u201cIf I had known (you were listening), I would have made it more beautiful for you,\u201d then that is OK. But if the reciting in a melodious voice is done in an artificial manner, with special training and musical rhythms, this is something which the salaf despised, and which they criticized and condemned. It is known that the salaf used to recite the Qur\u2019aan in a sad tone, making their voices beautiful and giving it a sad tone sometimes and a joyful tone sometimes. This is something natural. Defining the meaning of making the voice melodious (taghanni) (a)I say: there is no dispute concerning the validity of the fatwa of Imaam Maalik which is based on the hadeeth of the Signs of the Hour, with its various isnaads, and which states that it is not permitted to recite with a musical tune and following the rules of music in a manner that goes beyond the limits of recitation and correct pronunciation, and does not befit the dignity of the Qur\u2019aan. (b)The ahaadeeth of Anas and Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) refer to the recitation of the Khawaarij, who used to recite the Qur\u2019aan throughout the night and day, but it did not go any deeper than their throats or collar bones, because they did not have knowledge of the Sunnah which clarifies matters, so they were deprived of proper understanding and the reward for recitation. In the ahaadeeth it says that they would exit from the religion like an arrow passing through its target. The ahaadeeth contain the command to kill them and says that they are the most evil of creation, even though you would think that your prayer and your recitation are as nothing when compared with their prayer and recitation. This is the description of the Khawaarij and those who are like them. Ibn Taymiyah said: the hadeeth about the Khawaarij is saheeh in ten different isnaads, which were narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, and some of which were narrated by al-Bukhaari. The Khawaarij used to denounce the Muslims as kaafirs merely for committing sins, but they were the followers of bid\u2019ah (innovations) and misinterpretations who had split away from the mainstream of the ummah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in our religious commitment and their worldly affairs. This is a description which applies only to the Khawaarij and those who are like them. The reciters nowadays are not like this as far as we know. (c)The fatwa of Imaam Ahmad has to do with distorting the letters and exaggerating elongated vowels, which results from altering the letters and elongating them too much, which takes the recitation beyond what is correct. This fatwa states that it is emphatically disliked, as al-Qaadi Abu Ya\u2019laa said. This refers to someone who goes to extremes and whose recitation is not correct, because he adds letters, such as adding waw and alif to the word Muhammad, making it Moohaamad. This is haraam, according to consensus. At the time of Imaam Ahmad, the people used to sing poetry and elongate the letters however they wished. Ishaaq al-Mawsili criticized Ibraaheem ibn al-Mahdi for doing that, because he distorted the words from the way they should be in Arabic. And denouncing that in the case of reciting Qur\u2019aan in a melodious voice is more essential, and this problem does not exist nowadays, praise be to Allaah. (d)Ibn Taymiyah said: the kind of tune which the scholars regard as makrooh for reciting Qur\u2019aan in is that which involves shortening long letters, lengthening short letters, giving a vowel to a silent letter, or making a vowelled letter silent, in order to make it fit the rules of music. If that also involves changing the way the Qur\u2019aan should be recited and elongating the vowels, then this is haraam. Reconciling between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed There is no contradiction between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed if the prohibition applies to that which goes beyond the limits of correct recitation, whether by adding or taking away, or by neglecting an obligatory rule, or by going against the well-established rules of recitation. The prohibition also applies to that which is recited according to the rules of music, even if it is without the accompaniment of instruments, to make the voice tremble or quaver, or exaggerating in going along with a particular musical key which is in the reciter\u2019s mind whilst he is reciting. The permission applies only to that which is in accordance with the rules of sound recitation whilst making the voice beautiful. If what is meant by giving a tune is adding or taking away anything, or going against the well-established rules of recitation, this is haraam. If I mean making the voice melodious in recitation (taghanni), in order to make the listener feel happy or sad, or to soften his heart or to make the recitation attractive whilst also pondering the meanings and reflecting humility, then it is mustahabb, so long as it does not distort the meaning or change the pronunciation, or follow the rules of music. Al-Suyooti said: Reciting Qur\u2019aan with a tune and with beautiful, quavering voices, so long as it does not deviate from the correct way of reciting, is a good way (Sunnah hasanah); if it does deviate from the correct way of reciting, then it is haraam and is an evil deed. And he said in Sharh al-Risaalah: From the comments of the imams it may be understood that making the voice beautiful whilst paying attention to the rules of music and also following the rules of recitation is an area that is subject to scholarly dispute. Some of the scholars said that this is different from the way of the salaf, because the reader may neglect to recite properly, so they said that this was not permitted, in order to prevent the means that may lead to something haraam. But making the voice beautiful whilst reciting Qur\u2019aan, without paying attention to the rules of music is what is required, and there is no dispute concerning this. Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is mustahabb to read Qur\u2019aan with a sad tone, with a measured pace and with a beautiful voice. I say: this is taken from the hadeeth of Buraydah, \u201cRecite the Qur\u2019aan in a sad tone for it was revealed with sadness.\u201d And the hadeeth of Ibn \u2018Abbaas: \u201cThe best of people in reciting Qur\u2019aan is the one who recites it in a sad tone.\u201d But these hadeeths are both da\u2019eef (weak) and the first one is da\u2019eef jiddan (very weak).",

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has many names, all of which are indicative of His Greatness, Perfection and Majesty, may He be glorified and exalted. He has told us some of these Names in His Book and through the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); He also has other Names which are known only to Him, as is indicated in the hadeeth of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'There is nobody who is afflicted with distress or grief and who says: \"Allaahumma inni 'abduka wa ibn 'abdika wa ibn amatika, naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka 'adlun fiyya qadaa'uka, as'aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw 'allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta'tharta bihi fi 'ilmi al-ghaybi 'indaka an taj'al al-Qur'aana rabee'a qalbi wa noor sadri wa jilaa'a huzni wa dhihaaba hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is ever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur'aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety,\" - but Allaah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with ease.' He was asked, 'O Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?' He said, 'Of course, whoever hears it should learn it.'\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; this is a saheeh hadeeth). The Names of Allaah mentioned in the Qur'aan and Sunnah number over one hundred, as several scholars have agreed (see Al-Qawaa'id al-Muthlaa fi Sifaat Allaahi wa Asmaa'ihi by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn 'Uthaymeen). Among these are ninety-nine names which, if one learns them and acts in accordance with them, will bring a great reward, as is indicated in the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one; whoever learns them will enter Paradise.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2736) The learning referred to in the hadeeth includes the following: Memorizing them. Understanding their meanings. Acting upon them: so if a person learns that Allaah is al-Ahad (the One and Only), he will not associate anything else with Him; if he learns that He is al-Razzaaq (the Provider), he will not seek provision from anyone else; if he learns that He is al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), he will not despair of His Mercy, and so on. Calling upon Allaah by these Names, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them\" [al-A'raaf 7:180] - so one might say \"Yaa Rahmaan arhamni (O Most Merciful, have mercy on me),\" \"Yaa Ghafoor ighfir li (O All-Forgiving, forgive me),\" \"Yaa Tawwaab, tubb 'alayya (O Accepter of Repentance, turn towards me in forgiveness),\" and so on.

        "question": "I would be very grateful if you could advise me on the fundamental differences between the main sects of Islam, although I know that originally Islam was a unified religion. Thankyou.",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question is lengthy and deserves a book to itself. We cannot answer in details here, but we can say the following in brief: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us beforehand that this Ummah would be divided as the previous nations were divided, as stated in the saheeh hadeeth: Wahb ibn Baqiyyah told us from Khaalid from Muhammad ibn \u2018Amr from Abu Salamah from Abu Hurayrah who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Jews were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and the Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects.\u201d This was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sunnah, Baab Sharh al-Sunnah. It was reported from \u2018Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \u201cThe Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire.\u201d It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they? He said, \u201cAl-Jamaa\u2019ah.\u201d Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 3982. What is meant by al-Jamaa\u2019ah is the \u2018aqeedah and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. Among the sects that claim to belong to Islam are those who are misguided with regard to the Unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and His Names and Attributes; they say that everything that exists is Allaah and that He is incarnate or present in His creation \u2013 glorified be He far above what they say. On the contrary, He is above His heavens, settled on His throne, distinct from His creation. Others are misguided with regard to eeman (faith) and say that deeds are separate from faith and that faith does not increase or decrease. The correct view is that faith consists of words and deeds; it increases when one does acts of obedience to Allaah and decreases when one commits sin. Others are misguided by their declaring that the person who commits sin goes beyond the pale of Islam and is doomed to eternity in the Fire. The correct view is that the one who commits a major sin \u2013 apart from shirk and al-kufr al-akbar \u2013 does not go out of Islam. Others are misguided with regard to the issue of al-qadaa\u2019 wa\u2019l-qadar (divine decree), and said that man has no choice in what he does. The correct view is that man has freedom of will on the basis of which he will be called to account and will bear the consequences of his deeds. Others are misguided with regard to the Qur\u2019aan, and say that it is created. The correct view is that it is the words of Allaah, revealed not created. Others are misguided with regard to the Sahaabah, whom they revile and denounce as kaafirs even though they are the companions of the Prophet among whom the Wahy (Revelation) was revealed, and they are the most knowledgeable and the most devoted in worship among this Ummah, and they strove in jihaad for the sake of Allaah and Allaah supported this religion through them \u2013 may Allaah be pleased with them all. And there are other groups who deviated from the path of Islam and innovated matters in the religion of Allaah; each of them rejoices in what they have, but they have followed the ways of the Shaytaan and gone against the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)\u201d [al-An\u2019aam 6:153] We ask Allaah to make us among the followers of the Sunnah who will be saved from the Fire, and to admit us to Paradise among the righteous.

So give one saa\u2019 of whatever is the staple food in your country, such as rice or wheat, for example, on behalf of yourself and each member of your household. (A saa\u2019 is equivalent to approximately 3 kilograms). It is not permissible to give it to anyone except a needy Muslim.

        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Yes, Allaah will accept whatever righteous deeds he does, such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his repentance, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.\u201d [al-Shooraa 42:25]. But there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere. Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin. Zina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cAnd come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).\u201d [al-Isra\u2019 17:32]. Married people who commit zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment, which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a haraam manner even though they were not without a halaal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage). Unmarried people who commit zinaa, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in sharee\u2019ah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime. The punishment for those who are guilty of zinaa in Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself? We ask Allaah not to despise us and to accept our repentance; we ask Him to help us to do good and to avoid evil, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near.",
        "summary": "Praise is to Allah. Yes, Allaah accepts whatever righteous deeds a person does and accepts his repentance. But there is also the condition of sincere repentance. If this person sincerely repents, then he or she will be sentenced to one year in prison for the crime. Even married people who commit adultery are sentenced to up to 100 lashes; unmarried people are given the maximum amount of lashes. Unmarried people are punished with the most severe punishment: stoning to death. Married people are condemned to live in an oven for one year after death, before they die, until they get out of it, then they will go straight to Hell unless they repent.",

        "question": "what would be a good du'a or ayah to recite if you want Allah to open the heart of someone very close to you to Islam?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.The best thing to do in this situation is to pray for guidance for that person. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, as is reported in a number of ahadeeth, such as the following: Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that Tufayl ibn Amr al-Dawsi and his companions came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, Daws have rebelled and disobeyed, so pray to Allaah against them. People said, Now Daws are doomed! He said, O Allaah, guide Daws and bring them here. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2937). Abu Hurayrah said: I was calling my mother to Islam, when she was still a mushrik. One day I called her to Islam and she said something about the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that upset me. I came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping, and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I was calling my mother to Islam and she refused. Today I called her and she said something about you that upset me. Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. I left, feeling hopeful because of the Prophets prayer. When I got home, as I came near to the door I saw it was ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said, Stay where you are, Abu Hurayrah! I could hear the sound of water. She washed herself, got dressed and put on her khimaar (head covering). Then she opened the door and said, O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I went back to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping with joy, and said, O Messenger of Allaah, good news! Allaah has answered your prayer and has guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah. He praised and thanked Allaah, and said, That is good. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, pray to Allaah to make my mother and me dear to His believing slaves, and to make them dear to us. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, O Allaah, make this slave of Yours (meaning Abu Hurayrah) and his mother dear to Your believing slaves, and make the believers dear to them. There is no believer who hears of me or sees me, but he loves me. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4546). Jaabir said: They said, O Messenger of Allaah, we have suffered much from the arrows of Thaqeef (this was when they were fighting, before they became Muslim), so pray to Allaah against them. He said, O Allaah, guide Thaqeef. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: this is a hasan saheeh ghareeb hadeeth. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 3877).

        "question": "Why does Islam,believing that its roots lie with abraham,nonetheless not believe in the veracity of hebrew scriptures?",
        "answer": "Praise be to Allah.Muslims believe in all the Prophets and Messengers without exception; whoever denies any Prophet is a disbeliever. Muslims believe in all the Books that were revealed by Allaah to His Prophets, without exception; whoever denies any Book is a disbeliever. On this basis, Muslims believe in Moosa (Moses) as a Prophet from Allaah, and in the original Torah as a Book from Allaah, and in \u2018Eesa (Jesus) as a Prophet from Allaah, and in the original Gospel as a Book from Allaah. When the previous books were distorted and altered because of men\u2019s desires and division among the Jews and Christians, it was no longer possible to rely on them. Allaah abrogated all previous laws (sharee\u2019ahs) when Islam came, and all previous Books when the Qur\u2019aan was revealed. When He sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as the final Messenger and Seal of the Prophets, it became obligatory to believe in and follow the Qur\u2019aan which was revealed to him, especially since Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur\u2019aan and protect it from alteration and distortion, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cVerily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur\u2019aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption).\u201d [al-Hijr 15:9] Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is the Khaleel (Friend) of Allaah, the Father of the Prophets and the pride of the Muslims. Allaah sent him with the message of Tawheed (Divine unity) just as He sent Moosa, \u2018Eesa and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them all). The happiest of mankind is one who follows his way, which is Tawheed (belief in Divine unity). Because both the Jews and Christians claimed that Ibraaheem belonged to them, Allaah explained that they were both wrong, giving decisive historical evidence in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): \u201cO People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibraaheem, while the Tawraat and the Injeel were not revealed till after him? Have you then no sense? Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have no knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that which you have no knowledge? It is Allaah Who knows, and you know not. Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim haneefa (Islamic monotheism \u2013 worshipping none but Allaah alone), and he was not of al-mushrikoon (polytheists). Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibraaheem are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad (peace andb lessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who have believed (Muslims). And Allaah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.\u201d[Aal \u2018Imraan 3:65-68] Become Muslim and you will be saved. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.",

Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even for females, who must uphold them as much as they can. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to prevent his wife or daughter from upholding her ties of kinship, and if he stops her from visiting them, but he lets her convey greetings to them, whether by letter or through a third person, or send them gifts, then she should do that. It is sufficient even if she only sends greetings without a gift, but if she sends her greetings with a gift, that is better. If he stops her from sending a gift but allows her to send greetings, then she should send greetings. If he allows her to send a gift but stops her from sending greetings, then she should send a gift. If he allows her to go and see them, then she should go. If he stops her from doing anything that comes under the heading of upholding ties of kinship, then there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. In this case she should maintain her family ties in the way that is least objectionable to her husband or father, whether it is sending gifts or conveying greetings, and she can conceal that if she is fearful. If her relatives are faced with some hardship, she should help them with what they need, even if he says not to. She should uphold her family ties by offering condolences in the case of bereavement or loss, and condolence means advising patience. She should also congratulate them on joyful occasions, and congratulating them means praying that they will enjoy to the full whatever has brought them joy, and that it will not be spoilt for them. Such joyful events include the return of a traveller, a wedding, etc. She should not adorn herself or display her adornment in front of those to whom she should not show herself, such as cousins (sons of maternal uncles or paternal uncles), and she should convey her greetings to them from behind a barrier and without making her voice soft, but this is only in cases where there is no fear of fitnah, otherwise she may convey greetings through a third party. She does not have to attend funerals. It is not permissible for the husband to stop his wife from upholding the ties of kinship even if it involves her going out, but she should not go out except with his permission. The same applies to fathers. The wife should treat her husband gently so that she will still be able to fulfil her shar\u2019i duty of upholding the ties of kinship.

How many ships have there been after it that have turned to dust and left no trace!\" The apparent meaning is that this refers to ships in general, as in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): \"And an aayah (sign) for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nuh), And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.\" Yaa-Seen 36:41-42] \"Verily!

That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) understand it.\" [al-Haaqqah 69:11-12] Hence Allaah says here \"is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)?\" i.e., is there anyone who will remember and learn?

That Allaah has left this story as a lesson to those who come after the people of Nuh; 2. That Allaah has left the ship of Nuh so that subsequent nations may see it and learn from it how Allaah saved the believers and destroyed the kuffaar. 3. That Allaah taught mankind how to make ships and left this invention as a reminder of His blessings and how Nuhs children and the believers were saved by means of a ship like those which are well-known. In any case, there is nothing that would go against either Islamic teaching or reason if Nuhs ark were to be discovered and if generations of mankind after Nuh were to see it, because it would be a sign to them. The issue would be how to prove that the ship discovered was really Nuhs ark; not everyone who finds an ancient ship and claims it to be Nuhs ark is to be believed. And Allaah knows best.",
        "summary": "The ad-hoc narration begins with praise be to Allah, the creator of heaven and earth. He says that when the people rejected their Messenger, they rejected a madman who said he would not be allowed into heaven. Then they took his slave, made him an ark, and placed him on a ship made of plansks and nails Floating under our eyes. This story serves as a reminder for those who came before them about how terrible it was. It also refers to ships, which were left behind so that later generations of the ummah might learn from it.",
